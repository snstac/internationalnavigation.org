<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Courier New">Although John Alvin Pierce
(1907-1996) has been long lauded as a major contributor in the radio navigation
community, he made significant contributions in other technical fields. His
first scientific work was at Harvard University involving radio wave
measurements during solar eclipse periods. Later, somewhat by accident, he
became involved in studying theory of phonograph recording and playback with
Prof. F. V. Hunt at Harvard. This work resulted in publication of technical
papers which later laid the theoretical foundation for the long-playing
phonograph record, and subsequently, the stereophonic phonograph record.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Courier New">Jack Pierce was recruited
to assist war-time efforts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where
his knowledge of ionospheric effects on radio propagation was needed to develop
new electronic methods of navigation for military use. This work led to the
development and deployment of Long Range Navigation (LORAN) in the 1940s.
Although LORAN found immediate and enthusiastic acceptance, Jack Pierce did not
rest. He devoted the remainder of his long career to furthering radio techniques
for long-range navigation, positioning, and timing. His efforts produced LORAN-C
which remains in widespread use today, and also the Omega Navigation System
which provided worldwide navigation and timing service for several decades.
Omega was the first truly global radionavigation system: it set important
precedents regarding international cooperation in providing navigation services
until superseded by today's Global Positioning System and other satellite-based
systems. Jack Pierce was often honored by numerous professional organizations
for these contributions but he was always quick to point out that these
successes in radionavigation were not his alone but the result of collaboration
with other scientists and engineers.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">

</font>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Courier New">Jack Pierce was an ardent
supporter of the International Omega Association (IOA), forerunner of the
International Navigation Association (INA). The INA's highest award is named in
his honor: the John Alvin Pierce Award. He participated in several of our annual
meetings. Thanks to the cooperation of INA members working with American
Airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration, he was provided air
transportation and a cockpit pass to attend our 13<sup>th</sup> Annual Meeting
held 1988 in Munich, Germany. Thus, at the young age of 80 he was able to
observe Omega navigation equipment in operation as it steered his flight from
Boston to Munich across the Atlantic Ocean. He later said that this was the
first time he had ever seen Omega operating in a moving vehicle.</font></p>

<p><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p>
<b><font face="Courier New" size="2">
</font>
</b><font face="Courier New" size="2">
<p>After meeting Jack Pierce in Weare, New Hampshire, and reading these </p>
<p>memoirs, my wife described Jack as "a man of parts". He was also a </p>
<p>fine storyteller, and here follow the stories, on radionavigation up </p>
<p>to Omega, time and frequency, and many other things. Jack said he </p>
<p>would like to see these circulated to those in the field of </p>
<p>radionavigation. That dinner pre-dated the Worldwide Web, though not </p>
<p>by much; perhaps he anticipated the Web as well.</p>
<p>This document is, by definition, one man's perspective, and it is an </p>
<p>interesting history of the interaction between understanding of the </p>
<p>medium in which we live, enabling technology and geopolitics, from </p>
<p>the mid-1930s to mid-1980s and from VLF to HF: that is, "time and </p>
<p>frequency". Jack made important contributions, bringing knowledge of </p>
<p>timekeeping, physics and propagation to a real need. He worked with </p>
<p>many familiar names which have now passed into history: this is his </p>
<p>personal account of those times and those personalities.</p>
<p>Sometimes one realizes the absolutely obvious several decades after </p>
<p>the fact: the number of informal discussions to which Jack refers in </p>
<p>chapter 26 gave me an intuitive feel for the nature of the Omega </p>
<p>"signal in lightning". It is doubtful this would have come out of a </p>
<p>Washington briefing, or in as enjoyable a manner as in Jack's living </p>
<p>room in Arlington with the sun having been declared over the </p>
<p>yardarm. This induced me to a multistage hard-limiting receiver </p>
<p>design which preserved signal phase, was simple to produce, and </p>
<p>which certainly did perform better than the others. More like an </p>
<p>audio system than a traditional radio, it suprised the production </p>
<p>line by not having any twiddle knobs. Without the chats with Jack, </p>
<p>the Marconi Canada Omega navigator would not have been as good. So, </p>
<p>we were able to validate one of Jack's many visions by equipping the </p>
<p>Pan Am 707 fleet, and be in pole position for the rest of the Omega </p>
<p>story.</p>
<p>I have added nothing; headers, pages, footnotes and a table have </p>
<p>been reformatted slightly to fit on a pure-text A4/letter (210mm x </p>
<p>11 inch, 68 character x 55 line page).* A few personal portions were </p>
<p>deleted, but the 30 chapter numbers are unchanged.</p>

<p><a name="minor">The Making of a Minor Scientist </p>
</a>
</b>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>This memoir was first conceived as a collection of anecdotes or </p>
<p>accounts of things that have interested or amused me, with the </p>
<p>idea that our grandchildren could read them whenever they might </p>
<p>reach an age that would allow some interest in the doings of </p>
<p>their ancestors.</p>
<p>After beginning with a few family stories and my own </p>
<p>earliest recollections, I became interested in the writing itself </p>
<p>and realized that the tales could not be told without a </p>
<p>considerable amount of biographical material. The telling has </p>
<p>therefore become roughly chronological so that later episodes can </p>
<p>benefit from some understanding of earlier backgrounds.</p>
<p>Because my own interests have been largely technical rather </p>
<p>than personal, most readers will consider that I have given too much </p>
<p>space to my scientific or developmental problems. I can only </p>
<p>apologize half-heartedly for this condition, as I must describe </p>
<p>the way things have appeared to me.</p>
<p>The sequence in this volume is essentially that in which the </p>
<p>various chapters were written, and is largely chronological </p>
<p>except that the chapter about Catherine was written as soon as I </p>
<p>could bear to do so after her death. The writing of that and later </p>
<p>chapters suffers from the absence of her editorial consideration.</p>
<p>My efforts to choose from a large quantity of recollections and then </p>
<p>the attempt to tell the stories in concise form have made this </p>
<p>the most interesting and pleasant of any writing I have ever done. </p>
<p>I have written very little before that did not demand my every </p>
<p>effort to stick to strict scientific truth. I have found myself </p>
<p>continuing, therefore, in a relaxed and personal way, and very </p>
<p>largely for my own enjoyment.</p>

<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Father"></a>Father Harrington et al</p>
</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Father Harrington was the priest of a mixed Canadian-French and </p>
<p>Irish parish in Orono, Maine. His strong personality and aggressive </p>
<p>methods made him a focus of town gossip, especially among the </p>
<p>protestant youth. Much of this discussion dealt with rumors of his </p>
<p>hard tactics in extracting from his flock the support due the </p>
<p>church. In the face of these rumors, it was many years before I </p>
<p>realized that a parishioner in need always received a load of </p>
<p>groceries or a ton of coal when things were at their worst, and that </p>
<p>the protestant part of the town heard little or nothing about this </p>
<p>aspect of Father Harrington's mission.</p>
<p>My own acquaintance with Father Harrington was limited because he </p>
<p>did not serve until the time when I might have been able to maintain </p>
<p>an intelligent discussion with him. The great thing about Father </p>
<p>Harrington, to a young protestant boy, was that he had a motherly </p>
<p>housekeeper named Katie Mahoney who made better sugar cookies than </p>
<p>anyone. Throughout the neighborhood the recognized specific for a </p>
<p>bruise or a scraped knee was a visit to Katie Mahoney and her cookie </p>
<p>jars.</p>
<p>My earliest recollection of Father Harrington is that he came across </p>
<p>the street to our house one sunny morning, when I was idling on the </p>
<p>front steps, and gave me the first nickel I ever owned. I seem to </p>
<p>recall that I was curious, rather than impressed, until Mother </p>
<p>explained to me how many pieces of candy Miss Gee would give me for </p>
<p>the coin.</p>
<p>I suppose that Father Harrington had come to engage Grandpa in one </p>
<p>of the philosophical discussions that I am sure they both enjoyed. </p>
<p>Grandpa certainly rated as a pillar of the Congregational Church, </p>
<p>and I suspect that he stood almost alone as a protestant who would </p>
<p>allow himself to be seen talking with the priest, who was cordially </p>
<p>detested by many who were not of the Catholic faith, and perhaps by </p>
<p>some who were.</p>
<p>Grandpa's qualifications as a former college president and an </p>
<p>Emeritus Professor of Philosophy surely struck a chord in Father </p>
<p>Harrington and, unlikely as it seemed, a sincere friendship must </p>
<p>have existed between the two gentlemen. My strongest evidence to </p>
<p>support this belief came, when I was eight years old, in the short </p>
<p>interval between Grandpa's death and his funeral. On one of those </p>
<p>mornings Father Harrington called and was closeted with Grandma in </p>
<p>the big front parlor, with the sliding doors closed and Mother and </p>
<p>me both excluded. For what seemed an hour, the sounds of a violent </p>
<p>argument could be detected but not understood. I, at least, was </p>
<p>amazed, as I can recall no other occasion on which Grandma permitted </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Father Harrington 2</p>
<p>herself to raise her voice. After Father Harrington had taken his </p>
<p>leave, with some formality, and after Grandma had recovered her </p>
<p>gentle speech, she told Mother that Father Harrington had been </p>
<p>determined to have the bell of the Catholic church tolled during </p>
<p>Grandpa's funeral service - an action that Grandma considered most </p>
<p>inappropriate. It seems that Grandma must have won the debate </p>
<p>because, although I recall few other details of the funeral (aside </p>
<p>from the novelty of riding in a carriage) I am sure that the </p>
<p>Catholic bell remained silent. </p>
<p>One of Mother's and Grandma's favorite stories concerned an incident </p>
<p>that must have dated from about the time of the first nickel. When I </p>
<p>was three, the Congregational Church called a new minister, the </p>
<p>Reverend Mr. Lyman. It fell to my family to offer our house for the </p>
<p>reception soon after his arrival. This function was held in two </p>
<p>parts, one in the afternoon and the other in the evening. Apparently </p>
<p>Father Harrington did not feel that he could call at a time when </p>
<p>many protestants were present, but thought that he should convey his </p>
<p>respects. Showing his diplomatic talents, which were frequently </p>
<p>concealed, and also betraying the sharp watch he must have </p>
<p>maintained from across the street, he arrived at the end of the </p>
<p>afternoon session when all the Congregational parishioners had left </p>
<p>although Mr. Lyman was still there. Mother and Grandma were busy </p>
<p>clearing the afternoon debris and preparing for the evening session. </p>
<p>I have no idea where Grandpa and Mrs. Lyman may have been at this </p>
<p>time. In any case, the two clergymen were introduced and, of </p>
<p>necessity, left much to their own devices. For the rest of her life, </p>
<p>Mother often recalled with glee that, on returning to the parlor, </p>
<p>she found me in the center of the black walnut sofa with the priest </p>
<p>on one side and the minister on the other. In my hand was a large </p>
<p>sugar cookie. It may have been one of Katie Mahoney's, although that </p>
<p>seems improbable. After taking a bite, I would hold the cookie for </p>
<p>Mr. Lyman to take his bite, and then extend it to Father Harrington. </p>
<p>This sharing continued long enough so that Grandma could be called </p>
<p>to help witness it. She and Mother never tired of referring to this </p>
<p>as the first and possibly the last time that these gentlemen broke </p>
<p>bread together.</p>
<p>Father Harrington coveted a field, almost across the street from our </p>
<p>house, that was owned by our neighbor, Dr. Mayo, who was perhaps the </p>
<p>chief of all the protestants in dislike of the priest. Dr. Mayo </p>
<p>declined forcefully to sell the field to the parish but, fairly soon </p>
<p>after the death of my grandfather, Father Harrington, by the adroit </p>
<p>use of a dummy purchaser, gained control of the field and proceeded </p>
<p>to build a parochial school. This action precipitated the most </p>
<p>violent protestant reaction that I remember, with opinions ranging </p>
<p>through various degrees of the immoral to the illegal.</p>
<p>When the school building was approximately finished a motto reading </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><p align="CENTER"><a name="Mother"></p>
<p><hr>
<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p>Mother Raymond / Uncle Con</b> 3</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Saint Mary's School / for God and Country" was incised over the </p>
<p>door. At first this slogan did not show clearly, as the building was </p>
<p>set back from the street, so the letters were filled in with black </p>
<p>paint. This was done on a morning when Mother and I were gardening </p>
<p>in front of our house. It happened that the painter had only </p>
<p>completed the C and the O in the last word at his lunch time. During </p>
<p>this interval two tiny Catholic girls stopped near us while the </p>
<p>elder spelled out the motto for the younger one. "Saint Mary's </p>
<p>School", she read, "for God and Company". Then, after a pause for </p>
<p>consideration, "I guess the Company must be Father Harrington".</p>
<p>This veneration for the priest was known not to extend to one member </p>
<p>of his flock, Mr. Maloney. Father Harrington's appreciation of this </p>
<p>fact was shown when Grandma asked him what statue would be placed in </p>
<p>the niche above the motto. "I have not decided", Father Harrington </p>
<p>replied, "whether it shall be a statue of Dr. Mayo or one of Mr. </p>
<p>Maloney". It turned out that the statue of an angel with extended </p>
<p>wings and with children at his knee, that Father Harrington had </p>
<p>actually ordered, was too large for the niche. It was then placed on </p>
<p>a pedestal in the middle of the schoolyard. The niche was ultimately </p>
<p>occupied, perhaps more appropriately, by a statue of the Virgin.</p>
<p>The Coburn house, directly across the street from us, between the </p>
<p>priest's house and the new school, became the convent of the </p>
<p>teaching Sisters. The Mother Superior was Sister Mary Raymond, whom </p>
<p>I eventually came to recognize as very nearly a saint. At first, </p>
<p>however, there was no communication between our house and the </p>
<p>convent, perhaps because of our being neighbors and friends of the </p>
<p>Mayos.</p>
<p>Seven years after the convent had been founded, and after Dr. Mayo </p>
<p>had died, there came an afternoon when Grandma said to Mother, </p>
<p>"Harriet, put on your hat. Let us pay a call on the convent". Mother </p>
<p>Raymond received the ladies graciously and presently took them on a </p>
<p>tour of the school. In one room they found a Sister who was </p>
<p>lingering to finish her chores. When Mother Raymond introduced my </p>
<p>folks as "our neighbors from across the street", the Sister looked </p>
<p>up with a twinkle and remarked, "It has taken you quite a while to </p>
<p>get across". In spite of this slow start, happy relations came </p>
<p>rapidly. The friendship between Mother Raymond and Grandma, in </p>
<p>particular, reminded me very much of that which had previously </p>
<p>existed between Father Harrington and Grandpa.</p>
<p>The Sisters, of course, always traveled in pairs, and could go only </p>
<p>where they had a proper errand. Despite this limitation, Mother </p>
<p>Raymond was often in our house. Frequently Mother or Grandma would </p>
<p>bake a cake, or some other goody, and send me across the street to </p>
<p>hand it in at the convent door. This naturally led to the need to </p>
<p>return the cake tin or plate, so in a day or two Mother Raymond and </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mother Raymond / Uncle Con 4</p>
<p>one or another of the Sisters would return the dish; usually full of </p>
<p>fresh eggs as the convent kept a flock of hens. If I had so much </p>
<p>sickness as a bad cold, word would get to the convent and Mother </p>
<p>Raymond and a Sister would call. After addressing a few appropriate </p>
<p>words to the Lord and to me, they would settle down for an hour's </p>
<p>happy chat with Mother and Grandma.</p>
<p>The memory of Mother Raymond will always be especially dear to me as </p>
<p>she, more than all others, found the right words to renew my courage </p>
<p>after the death of my mother. This event was perhaps particularly </p>
<p>hard because it happened after I had come to fully realize how much </p>
<p>Mother had sacrificed for me all my life and before I had become </p>
<p>able to do much for her in return. Without my finding the words to </p>
<p>say any of this very well, Mother Raymond seemed to understand. </p>
<p>Certainly her sympathy and support saved me from extreme depression, </p>
<p>if not worse. </p>
<p>The rapport between our rigidly Congregational household and our </p>
<p>Catholic neighbors may have been enhanced by the memories of a black </p>
<p>sheep in the family, of whom I think Grandma was somewhat proud. </p>
<p>This gentleman was her brother, Joseph Converse Heywood, who was, </p>
<p>until the age of forty or more, the dramatic critic and an essayist </p>
<p>on the New York "Sun". He also wrote immensely long epic poems on </p>
<p>biblical subjects, such as "Salome". These must be, today, totally </p>
<p>unreadable, but in the Victorian era they were favorably received, </p>
<p>possibly in part because of "Uncle Con's" position as a critic. Some </p>
<p>quotations I recall in publisher's "blurbs" might have made one </p>
<p>think that Heywood was a second Shakespeare. In that era Uncle Con </p>
<p>had the reputation, according to Grandma, of being the only man in </p>
<p>New York who knew every possible place where one could buy a drink. </p>
<p>This status came to an end when Uncle Con married a very wealthy </p>
<p>woman of the Catholic faith. Almost the first the family heard was </p>
<p>that the new couple had moved to Rome. The second surprising piece </p>
<p>of news was that Uncle Con had become American Chamberlain to the </p>
<p>Pope, which authorized him to wear a remarkable uniform, fortunately </p>
<p>only required on State occasions. He lived in the Palazzo Torlonia, </p>
<p>where he assembled what was reputed to be the finest private library </p>
<p>in Rome. His ring, along the lines of that of an archbishop, and a </p>
<p>magnificent portrait of him in his uniform, wearing the most </p>
<p>generous bifurcated beard I have ever seen represented, came to </p>
<p>Grandma after Uncle Con's death and were objects of veneration to </p>
<p>me. </p>
<p>There must have been some substance to these tales. Grandpa and </p>
<p>Grandma made their only trip to Europe a half dozen years after </p>
<p>Uncle Con's death. In Rome, Grandma mentioned his name to someone </p>
<p>with the result that the Vatican opened its doors for the visitors. </p>
<p>My grandparents were granted an audience with the Pope and were so </p>
<p>generously entertained by Cardinals whose names I no longer remember </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Con">Uncle Con "Aramaic"</b> </a>5</p>
<p>that Grandma often referred to this episode throughout the rest of </p>
<p>her life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My favorite story about Father Harrington came to me third hand, </p>
<p>through Grandpa and Grandma. Because my grandparents were both </p>
<p>personifications of honor, I cannot conceive of their having </p>
<p>modified this, or any other, story except perhaps by smoothing any </p>
<p>rough edges to forestall someone's hurt feelings.</p>
<p>It seems that after many years of his service in Orono a purse was </p>
<p>made up for Father Harrington to make possible a trip to the Holy </p>
<p>Land, followed by an extended visit to Ireland. I have heard that </p>
<p>the Father's wealthier parishioners found a way to suggest to him, </p>
<p>while in Ireland, that he would be maintained there permanently if </p>
<p>he cared to stay. This part of the story may well be apochryphal. If </p>
<p>there was such an offer, it was declined.</p>
<p>On his return, Father Harrington told Grandpa about a shipboard </p>
<p>encounter. One morning, after he had been pacing the deck reading </p>
<p>his prayers, he was approached by a young man in the garb of an </p>
<p>Episcopal curate. To open the conversation, the curate said, "I see, </p>
<p>Father, that you have been reading your prayers in Latin. I assume </p>
<p>then that you know that language well." Father Harrington agreed </p>
<p>that he was an excellent Latin scholar, so the young man enquired </p>
<p>about Greek, of which Father Harrington admitted to a perhaps </p>
<p>exceptional knowledge. The enquiry then proceeded through Hebrew and </p>
<p>a number of modern languages. Father Harrington claimed at least </p>
<p>adequate knowledge of all of them. At last the young man said, "You </p>
<p>are really an unusual expert in languages, Father. It makes me hope </p>
<p>that perhaps you may know some of the language that Christ spoke </p>
<p>when on earth. I have always longed to hear a few words spoken in </p>
<p>Aramaic". At this point Father Harrington exhibited some modesty, </p>
<p>but admitted that he had a slight knowledge of that language. "Would </p>
<p>it please you", he said, "if I were to recite the Lord's Prayer for </p>
<p>you in Aramaic?" The offer was, of course, gratefully accepted. In </p>
<p>telling Grandpa about the occasion Father Harrington concluded, "I </p>
<p>said it for him and sent him away perfectly happy". Then, after a </p>
<p>quizzical look (and in what Grandma later conveyed to me in a </p>
<p>somewhat exaggerated brogue), "I said it in Irish, but it did him </p>
<p>just as much good".</p>

<b><p><a name="Appreciation">Father Harrington's Appreciation</b> </a>6</p>
<p>I do not intend this anecdote to indicate any lack of respect for </p>
<p>the memory of Father Harrington. I can best restore the correct tone </p>
<p>by quoting the priest's "Appreciation" that was dated on the day of </p>
<p>Grandpa's death and published in a Bangor paper. It read: </p>
<p>"It is 16 years last October since first I met Dr. Fernald. I loved </p>
<p>and admired him then, and my love and admiration for him have </p>
<p>intensified and increased as years rolled by.</p>
<p>"He was a gentleman in the true sense of the word, noble in acts, </p>
<p>refined in manners, wellbred, educated, courteous, kind and </p>
<p>honorable, and carrying into public life the high standard of his </p>
<p>private morals. He was a true type of the gentleman of the old </p>
<p>school, which is unfortunately fast passing away but which has left </p>
<p>its impression in the generation in which he lived and its influence </p>
<p>even in the present. All, irrespective of creed or politics, revered </p>
<p>and loved him, for he was an upright citizen, than whom there was no </p>
<p>better in Orono: charitable, both in word and deed, whose good </p>
<p>works, in their entirety, are known only by Him who scrutinizes the </p>
<p>heart.</p>
<p>"He always helped to legislate what he considered best for the </p>
<p>benefit of the community, and as a neighbor, with all the </p>
<p>characteristics of a Christian gentleman. Dr. Fernald's memory will </p>
<p>be long and fondly cherished by his friend, </p>

<p><a name="family">The Family in Orono</b> </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Grandpa">Grandpa</a></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My maternal Grandfather died a few weeks after my eighth birthday, </p>
<p>so I directly recall relatively little about him. The best evidence </p>
<p>of his ability and devotion to duty is to be found in, or between </p>
<p>the lines of, his "History of the University of Maine". He was </p>
<p>called to the Professorship of Mathematics and the Acting Presidency </p>
<p>of the Maine State College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts in </p>
<p>1868, when the first class matriculated. An interesting footnote is </p>
<p>that he and the Farm Superintendent, Samuel Johnson, were the entire </p>
<p>faculty for the first year. I have never known what the duties of </p>
<p>the Farm Superintendent may have been, but he, like Grandpa, had a </p>
<p>Master of Arts degree from Bowdoin.</p>
<p>Before going to Orono, Grandpa had spent several years as a teacher </p>
<p>or principal at some of the better known academies in Maine. He </p>
<p>served the college (and, later, University) for nearly forty years </p>
<p>except for two or three in the 1890s when his health failed. An </p>
<p>indication of his trials is to be found in the fact that the total </p>
<p>of the state appropriations for the college in the first four years </p>
<p>of his presidency in his own right (beginning in 1879) was $6,500.</p>
<p>I always knew that Grandpa had lived to be greatly respected and </p>
<p>honored. Once when I was a boy I found an old trunk in the attic </p>
<p>containing diplomas attesting to nearly thirty honorary degrees. It </p>
<p>is interesting that, in his History he mentions only three of these, </p>
<p>two from Bowdoin and one from Maine.</p>
<p>Grandpa was of about average height for his era, but of an erect, </p>
<p>not to say proud, carriage. He was distinguished in his later years </p>
<p>by a glorious pair of snowwhite sideburns extending as low as his </p>
<p>chin, while the chin itself was clean shaven. I am sure that he </p>
<p>never appeared in public, even to walk to the Post Office for the </p>
<p>mail, without his frock coat and silk hat. He used to delight me in </p>
<p>church. After seating his family in his pew, he would settle himself </p>
<p>at the end of it and extract from somewhere a beautiful black </p>
<p>watered silk skullcap which he would adjust carefully to protect his </p>
<p>bald head. I used to suspect that the organist timed the first bars </p>
<p>of "Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty", with which the service </p>
<p>always began, from the settling of Grandpa's skullcap.</p>
<p>One recollection is of my delight when on somewhat rare occasions </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grandpa 8</p>
<p>(possibly when I had been good) I was allowed to sit on Grandpa's </p>
<p>bed in the morning, or on his lap in the evening, and operate his </p>
<p>great, gold, minute repeater watch. I seem to remember that this </p>
<p>worked with a single bell ringing the hours, then double strokes for </p>
<p>the quarters, and finally single strokes again for the remainder of </p>
<p>the minutes; but my memory may be incorrect about this detail. The </p>
<p>memory certainly is aided by one of Mother's favorite photographs of </p>
<p>her father that showed Grandpa and me, complete with long blond </p>
<p>hair, on Grandpa's knee and looking at his watch.</p>
<p>I can understand not having forgotten the time when, returning from </p>
<p>a winter walk when I was about six, Grandpa and I broke through the </p>
<p>ice of the "frog pond" two or three hundred yards behind our house. </p>
<p>The water was about up to Grandpa' chest, but I think he managed to </p>
<p>keep me from submerging. Placing me on his shoulder and holding me </p>
<p>with one hand, he broke the ice with the other until we reached the </p>
<p>shore. I have never heard that there was any, witness to this </p>
<p>mishap. This is a pity, as I should treasure a description of </p>
<p>Grandpa, in his customary frock coat, coming dripping up out of the </p>
<p>pond.</p>
<p>In all probability this episode ended with my being dosed with </p>
<p>Mother's favorite specific for coughs or bronchitis: white of egg </p>
<p>beaten up with honey and, if the need were severe, a little whisky. </p>
<p>Grandpa would, of course, never allow liquor in the house, except a </p>
<p>bit for medical purposes. He could not, I suppose, forestall the </p>
<p>occasional gift of a bottle. After my folks were all dead, I found a </p>
<p>dozen or more excellent liquors in a remote corner of a cellar </p>
<p>cupboard. This collection included the only bottle of Napoleon </p>
<p>brandy I ever saw, so I deduce that Grandpa had instinctive good </p>
<p>judgment or had taken a bit of advice from someone.</p>
<p>One of the proud moments of my young life was when I stumped Grandpa </p>
<p>with an anagram. A frequent game at our house, probably to teach me </p>
<p>to spell, was to pass each other scrambled cardboard letters that </p>
<p>would form a word when put into the proper sequence. In one game, </p>
<p>near the end of his life, Grandpa admitted defeat in trying to </p>
<p>arrange the word "carrying" which I had given him. Possibly my </p>
<p>bedtime pressed upon him; it is inconceivable that he would have </p>
<p>deceived me by pretending something that was not the exact truth.</p>
<p>The only serious talk with Grandpa that I can recall was when he </p>
<p>told me that, because of the changing times and the spread of </p>
<p>education, I would know more when I graduated from high school than </p>
<p>he had had to know to graduate from Bowdoin College. Although I </p>
<p>readily admit the principle, when I compare my grandfather's ability </p>
<p>with my own I cannot help feeling that, for once at least, Grandpa </p>
<p>had made an error in judgment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grandpa 9</p>
<p>Often in the years after Grandpa died, presumably at times when I </p>
<p>displayed the somewhat violent disposition I had as a child, Grandma </p>
<p>would remind me of Grandpa's proud claim that he had never in his </p>
<p>life lost his temper. Occasionally she would thoughtfully amend this </p>
<p>statement by recalling that from time to time circumstances had </p>
<p>forced him into an intense state of "righteous indignation". </p>
<p>One of these occasions may have been when a small screw came out of </p>
<p>the rotary beater and was lost in the whipped cream topping for the </p>
<p>dessert for a dinner of the Conversation Club. Time did not permit </p>
<p>Grandma to do anything except serve the dinner and hope. Fortunately </p>
<p>nothing untoward happened until after the guests had left, when </p>
<p>Grandpa produced the screw from his vestpocket and demanded an </p>
<p>explanation of how such a thing could have been allowed to happen in </p>
<p>his house. GrandPa's indignation at this time may have been </p>
<p>accentuated by the partial elation of what Grandma often cited as </p>
<p>his favorite household dictum: "Anything really worth eating is </p>
<p>better with whipped cream on it".</p>
<p>My Fernald grandmother was born in a farmhouse in Weld, Maine. Her </p>
<p>middle name commemorated Elijah Lovejoy, a famous cousin of her </p>
<p>father who was called the first martyr in the abolition movement, </p>
<p>and is alternatively venerated for having lost his life in defence </p>
<p>of the principle of the freedom of the press.</p>
<p>After her mother died when she was six years old, Grandma was sent </p>
<p>to live with a favorite aunt, the former Harriet Converse, in New </p>
<p>Bedford, Massachusetts. The husband, Cornelius Howland, was a </p>
<p>relative of Henrietta Howland Robinson who later became famous as </p>
<p>the miser Hetty Green, a financier who left a fortune of a hundred </p>
<p>million dollars in the early part of this century. Grandma sometimes </p>
<p>referred to "having played" with Hetty Green when she was a small </p>
<p>child. Because my encyclopedia tells me that Hetty was ten years </p>
<p>older than Grandma, I incline to the happy thought that Hetty may </p>
<p>have been Grandma's babysitter.</p>
<p>Two years after his first wife died, my great grandfather married </p>
<p>Phebe (Kimball) Russell, a widow who brought two stepsisters into </p>
<p>the family. One of these, Susanna, later had a daughter Elizabeth </p>
<p>(Merrill) Hay who always remained a favorite "niece" of Grandma, and </p>
<p>who lived to be a member of her church in Portland for eighty-eight </p>
<p>years. I mention these geneological details only to support the </p>
<p>suggestion that Grandma returned from New Bedford in time to have </p>
<p>most of her schooling in Bethel, Maine, to which her father, a </p>
<p>former schoolteacher, had moved after his second marriage. This </p>
<p>question of where Grandma was educated interests me as she somehow </p>
<p>acquired a formidable amount of learning in her early years.</p>
<p>Grandma began teaching at the age of fourteen, presumably in Bethel. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Grandma">Grandma</b> </a>10</p>
<p>She once told me that it was in a typical one-room schoolhouse and </p>
<p>that her first pupils ranged in age from five to twenty-two. She was </p>
<p>proud of the fact that on her twenty-first birthday she was teaching </p>
<p>her twenty-first term of school. This claim I find barely possible, </p>
<p>on the assumption that Grandma taught in the first year after her </p>
<p>marriage, as she was presumably five months pregnant with my mother </p>
<p>on her twenty-first birthday. </p>
<p>I knew that Grandma had been a teacher as a girl, and even that she </p>
<p>had been able to help some now forgotten professor to prepare a </p>
<p>Latin grammar and, I think, dictionary. I also knew that she had </p>
<p>helped unofficially in any way she could in the early days of the </p>
<p>State College. I was, however, surprised, long after Grandma's </p>
<p>death, to find that she was listed among the faculty, in the third </p>
<p>year of the college, as Instructor in French and German.</p>
<p>Grandma and Grandpa met when she was teaching in the public school </p>
<p>at Bethel and he came there as principal of Gould Academy. A year or </p>
<p>two later when he had moved, or at least been appointed, to Houlton </p>
<p>Academy, Grandma finally chose a time when her father seemed to be </p>
<p>in a good mood, for an important question. The father was Winslow </p>
<p>Heywood, a taciturn man about whom I know only the detail that he </p>
<p>believed it best to eat only one kind of food at a meal. This meant </p>
<p>that his unfortunate wife had to prepare meat, potatoes, vegetables, </p>
<p>pies, and cakes so that, whatever he decided to eat, there would be </p>
<p>enough for his entire meal.</p>
<p>At the chosen time, Grandma approached her problem as follows: </p>
<p>"Father", she said, "Would it be all right if I should go to teach </p>
<p>at Houlton next year?" "No", said her father. "Well, Father, would </p>
<p>it be all right if Mr. Fernald and I were married first?" "Yes", </p>
<p>said Father, ending the conversation on that subject.</p>
<p>I gradually realized, as I was growing up, that Grandma had a </p>
<p>phenomenal memory. Much of this discovery came to me at Commencement </p>
<p>times when our house seemed to become a sort of secondary reunion </p>
<p>head quarters. For two or three days there would be a steady stream </p>
<p>of old graduates, many of whom had tears in their eyes as they </p>
<p>recalled, for example, how it had been Grandma, back in the 1880s, </p>
<p>who had managed to say the magic words that had prevented the young </p>
<p>men from dropping out of college. These and similar testimonials to </p>
<p>her mothering of the college interested me, but were not surprises. </p>
<p>What did astonish mG, as more and more evidence accumulated, was </p>
<p>that Grandma not only always recognized the old students but almost </p>
<p>invariably knew whom they had married and the names of their </p>
<p>children.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Memory">Grandma's Memory </a>11</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My highest tribute to Grandma's powerful memory comes from the Fall </p>
<p>of 1922, in my third year of High School. When I had begun studying </p>
<p>Latin as a freshman, I had had great hopes of help from Grandma. </p>
<p>These hopes were in vain, because she believed that I had to learn </p>
<p>for myself, and she resolutely refused any help at all. The Latin </p>
<p>classes were quite small with the result that the third and fourth </p>
<p>years were combined into a single class. I happened to enter this </p>
<p>pattern in the "bad" phase and found myself leaping from last </p>
<p>Spring's "Gallic Wars" into this Fall's "Aenead". After a few weeks </p>
<p>it must have become obvious that I was floundering, for one evening </p>
<p>I succeeded in getting Grandma to take the book and explain a </p>
<p>construction that baffled me. Having done this without difficulty </p>
<p>she, of course, found the book in her hand and almost automatically </p>
<p>began to read, because we were a family that read out loud to each </p>
<p>other as a matter of course. Grandma read the Virgil in a beautiful </p>
<p>translation, without hesitating over a word, exactly as though it </p>
<p>had been a novel in English. I was astonished, because I had thought </p>
<p>that one read two words of Latin and then looked up the third in the </p>
<p>vocabulary. Grandma however, became interested in the story and read </p>
<p>aloud for nearly two hours while, after a partial recovery from my </p>
<p>amazement, I made notes as fast as I could. When bedtime approached </p>
<p>she finally closed the book and leaned back in her rockingchair. </p>
<p>After a few minutes thought she said, "Do you know, I believe that </p>
<p>it's fifty two years since I looked at a Latin book".</p>
<p>While Grandma's phenomenal memory and great intelligence certainly </p>
<p>were an asset in her social relations, as in everything else, I </p>
<p>think it must have been her gentle urbanity that endeared her to </p>
<p>most people. It seemed to me that she was seldom really surprised at </p>
<p>anything, least of all by my pranks and misdemeanors. She apparently </p>
<p>felt that these taught their own lessons, and did not often allow </p>
<p>herself to show that she had heard of them. </p>
<p>In conversation, Grandma invariably expressed the expected degree of </p>
<p>surprise, but in such a soft and courteous way that I felt that, </p>
<p>having foreseen everything, she was simply making the orthodox </p>
<p>replies to conversational gambits. For minor occasions of a totally </p>
<p>unexpected and private nature, such as the breaking of a dish, she </p>
<p>reserved her only exclamamation, "Great Jehosephat!" </p>
<p>Grandma got more pleasure out of a Victorian era joke or an amusing </p>
<p>happening than anyone I ever knew. It may be a hundred times that I </p>
<p>heard her chuckle when something reminded her of an occasion when </p>
<p>she had been enquiring for some part time help. She was called to </p>
<p>the door by a burly Irish woman who said, somewhat belligerently, </p>
<p>"You the woman what wants someone to do cleaning? Well, I'm the lady </p>
<p>what wants the job".</p>

<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Poetry">Grandma's Poetry</b> </a>12</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grandma left a number of compositions, mostly poetic, that she had </p>
<p>written in various eras. A long poem in "epic" form, abounding in </p>
<p>classical references, is a clever and eloquent tirade called "The </p>
<p>Whole Duty of Woman". This is written in an accurate imitation of </p>
<p>the style of the women's magazines of the late Victorian period, and </p>
<p>deals with the ultimately overpowering weight of the myriad social </p>
<p>and familial obligations falling on the shoulders of a married </p>
<p>woman. Another composition, a long paper to be read to a women's </p>
<p>club, describes her summer in Europe with Grandpa after his </p>
<p>retirement. This is presented in exactly the tone of a travel book </p>
<p>of the 1910 era; a vastly different language from that of her </p>
<p>letters and other examples of her prose.</p>
<p>My favorite of her surviving compositions is a series of "charades" </p>
<p>in verse. These use, as do acted charades, "my one" or "my first" to </p>
<p>represent the initial syllable of an unknown word. I have copies of </p>
<p>more than a hundred of these written in assorted styles and meters, </p>
<p>many of them in recognized verse forms. A sample follows: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time was when a big my one was well nigh filled </p>
<p>Each day with plenty like my whole, and we </p>
<p>My second but the biggest; in our scorn, </p>
<p>Our ignorant scorn, we deemed the little ones, </p>
<p>Which now are rare as pearls, as only fit </p>
<p>For casting before swine. How times have changed! </p>
<p>My last! yea double my last! O tempora! </p>
<p>O mores! fain would we now fill ourselves </p>
<p>With what in former days the swine did eat. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be helpful to remark that this charade, like most of </p>
<p>Grandma's others, was composed at the time of the shortages in the </p>
<p>World War I era. I suspect that this form of amusement was adopted </p>
<p>to keep her mind occupied in the years immediately following the </p>
<p>death of my grandfather in 1916.</p>
<p>Grandma apparently had fun in composing charades in various verse </p>
<p>forms, including one imitated from Victor Hugo which starts with a </p>
<p>verse of one line having one syllable, followed by the second in two </p>
<p>lines of two syllables each. The count builds up gradually to seven </p>
<p>lines of seven syllables and then descends in the reverse pattern to </p>
<p>end with a single syllable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grandma's Poetry 13</p>
<p>Grandma seems to have been especially interested in a number of Old </p>
<p>French verse forms, as she names them in several cases where she </p>
<p>employed them. An example is the Virelay: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a gala day. A mass </p>
<p>Of people, drawn from every class </p>
<p>Waits patiently along the street. </p>
<p>Upon the lawns, in the cool grass </p>
<p>Many a little lad and lass </p>
<p>Trips round on eager, restless feet. </p>
<p>Their questions older ears harass. </p>
<p>Ah! now is heard the blare of brass. </p>
<p>The fife's shrill note, the drum's loud beat</p>
<p>As these their joyous strains repeat, </p>
<p>My one appears with movement fleet, </p>
<p>But held in steady, firm control, </p>
<p>Adorned with flowers gay and sweet. </p>
<p>On my grandfather's farm complete </p>
<p>My two was builded by my whole, </p>
<p>A safe, though not a still retreat, </p>
<p>From which strange sounds the ear did greet </p>
<p>From what was then almost the sole </p>
<p>Source of my two; which now seems droll. </p>
<p>My three no meaning has t'unroll, </p>
<p>Unless to multiply by three. </p>
<p>A little child, whose wished for goal </p>
<p>Was Alice's queer rabbit hole </p>
<p>Or mirror's back, was taken to see </p>
<p>Stuffed beasts, from elephant to mole. </p>
<p>As on his sight the walrus stole, </p>
<p>"Where is my whole?", inquired he. </p>
<p>I am fond of these charades in part because they are the only two </p>
<p>that I am sure I recall reading in my boyhood. The second also is </p>
<p>remembered as it contains a reference to me in the last verse. Like </p>
<p>most of these charades, it is full of resonances, such as the </p>
<p>reference to the goosequill pen that spans the second and third </p>
<p>verses, The answers to the riddles are, of course, "Potato" and </p>
<p>"Carpenter".</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grandma's serenity was too alert and interested to be called calm or </p>
<p>placid. She was quiet and gentle, yet she never in her life missed a </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grandma's Poems 14</p>
<p>nuance. She had, in her day, done a great deal, helping with the </p>
<p>struggling college to an extent that can never be known; raising </p>
<p>five children and somehow getting them all through college without </p>
<p>any very recognizable financial resources; and most certainly </p>
<p>freeing my grandfather for his duties and interests to a truly </p>
<p>nineteenth century degree. In her old age, when I knew her, she must </p>
<p>have been more content with her life than is usual today.</p>
<p>Her end was very characteristic of Grandma. As nearly as I can </p>
<p>judge, she simply died of old age, perhaps accelerated by an attack </p>
<p>of sciatica. The sciatica put her to bed, from which she did not </p>
<p>recover the strength to rise, and she died quietly after a few </p>
<p>months. She spent much of the intervening interval composing </p>
<p>crossword puzzles for solving even the most difficult ones had long </p>
<p>been too easy to interest her and planning her funeral. She felt </p>
<p>that she could do this better than anyone else, because of her </p>
<p>unexcelled knowledge of local protocol and local animosities. She </p>
<p>left complete instructions: who were to be bearers and who honorary </p>
<p>bearers; what the minister might be encouraged to say and what ideas </p>
<p>he might be advised to avoid; the music and who should be asked to </p>
<p>play and sing it; and who should be invited to ride in the first </p>
<p>car, the second, and so on.</p>
<p>I suppose that this plan gave grandma her last feeling of </p>
<p>satisfaction with her work. She certainly wrote it with pleasure, </p>
<p>and I shall always remember the keen interest with which she read </p>
<p>and explained the plan to me. Fortunately, I have now forgotten the </p>
<p>reasons why certain pairs of gentlemen and, especially, of ladies </p>
<p>could not be asked to share a car.</p>
<p>At the end, I am sure she was ready and glad to join her husband in </p>
<p>the cemetery lot at the crest of the river bank, across the </p>
<p>Stillwater River from the campus. She had once told me, in a remark </p>
<p>I still find it very difficult to explain that Grandpa had chosen </p>
<p>the lot because from there "he could keep an eye on the University".</p>

<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Dad">Father</a></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know remarkably little about my father and his family because he </p>
<p>died before I was a year old and thereafter it always hurt Mother to </p>
<p>talk about him. His people, among whom the elder sons had been John </p>
<p>Pierces for generations, had moved south in the early 1800s and had </p>
<p>lived in North Carolina, where my grandfather had a nursery </p>
<p>business, until shortly before the Civil War. They then moved to </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Father / Mother 15</p>
<p>Indiana, where Father was born, and then to southern Illinois, where </p>
<p>he grew up.</p>
<p>Father graduated from the University of Michigan and took his law </p>
<p>degree at Columbia University. While in New York he met Mother, who </p>
<p>also was studying there. Although they became engaged in that era, </p>
<p>he, in true Victorian fashion, had to establish himself before the </p>
<p>young couple could be married. He chose to go to the Washington </p>
<p>Territory so that his law office could grow with the new state. The </p>
<p>financial panic of 1893 cost him most of his savings so that it was </p>
<p>not until 1897 that he felt secure enough for marriage. As a result, </p>
<p>Mother told me sadly, they were engaged for ten years, in the last </p>
<p>nine of which they did not see each other until Father came east for </p>
<p>the wedding. I have always felt that this ten-year wait followed by </p>
<p>less than eleven years of marriage helped to explain why it was so </p>
<p>hard for Mother to talk about Father and their early days. </p>
<p>Father died of pneumonia in the summer of 1908. Somehow, within a </p>
<p>month, Mother managed to bring my sister and me to Orono to live </p>
<p>with her parents.</p>
</font><p><hr>
<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Mom">Mother </a></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like her parents, my mother must have been a remarkable person. </p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, because she was forty-one years old when I was </p>
<p>born and because of illness and tragedy, she had lost much of her </p>
<p>sparkle in the days when I knew her well.</p>
<p>Mother was two years old when Grandpa was called to Orono. She was </p>
<p>the first of five children, all the others being boys. She must, </p>
<p>therefore, have learned her homemaking skills early in life. She </p>
<p>graduated from the Maine State College in 1884, before she was </p>
<p>eighteen years old, and then went to New York where she became a </p>
<p>graduate of Melville Dewey's first class when he founded his library </p>
<p>school, which later became part of Columbia University.</p>
<p>This training qualified her for one of the first professions open to </p>
<p>ladies. She spent some time cataloging university libraries, among </p>
<p>them, I remember, Michigan and Pennsylvania State. She was employed </p>
<p>in the same capacity at Maine for a year or so and then, in 1890, </p>
<p>became the first fulltime librarian there. She also inaugurated and </p>
<p>taught a course in Library Science.</p>
<p>Mother retired from these duties to be married in 1897 and went to </p>
<p>Spokane, Washington, with my father. My only sister was born in 1898 </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mother 16</p>
<p>and I made my appearance nearly ten years later. After father's </p>
<p>death in the following year, Mother, with the two children, returned </p>
<p>to Orono. My sister died just before her twelfth birthday in 1910. </p>
<p>After Grandpa died in 1916, Mother and Grandma devoted the rest of </p>
<p>their lives primarily to raising me; not an easy task as I was </p>
<p>headstrong and Father did not leave a very large estate.</p>
<p>Mother was an excellent musician. She had had, I was told, a fine </p>
<p>singing voice with a range of more than three octaves. She called </p>
<p>herself a mezzo-soprano but could sustain any quality from alto to </p>
<p>coloratura. Unfortunately she had lost most of this talent by the </p>
<p>time I was old enough to be interested. Mother was also a remarkable </p>
<p>pianist. She was the only person I ever knew who could </p>
<p>simultaneously sightread and transpose difficult music, so that she </p>
<p>could play in any desired key. She owned, for some reason, one of </p>
<p>the rare Norris and Hyde pianos with a transposing keyboard, a </p>
<p>device that slid the keyboard as much as half an octave in either </p>
<p>direction. She never used this feature her self, finding it better </p>
<p>to transpose the music mentally, but the piano was a great source of </p>
<p>interest to me.</p>
<p>Mother had a fine collection of sheet music, classical and romantic. </p>
<p>There was certainly nothing more "popular" than, say, Massenet or </p>
<p>perhaps Ethelbert Nevin. Because she liked variety and had such a </p>
<p>fine collection, she never troubled to memorize anything. I came to </p>
<p>grieve over this habit because, by the time I was in High School, </p>
<p>she was developing cataracts and could no longer read music. Rather </p>
<p>than try to satisfy herself with second rate playing, she simply </p>
<p>gave up the piano and never touched it again, although she kept it </p>
<p>meticulously tuned for my ineffectual efforts to learn to play it.</p>
<p>Mother, as befitted a former librarian, was an omnivorous reader and </p>
<p>either she or my grandparents, or both, had assembled an excellent </p>
<p>library with sets of Scott, Thackeray, Dickens, Stevenson, and so </p>
<p>on. There were also large numbers of reference works and </p>
<p>biographies, and Grandpa's books on mathematics and physics, from </p>
<p>which I practically learned to read. The nineteenth and early </p>
<p>twentieth century novelists were all there, as far as Joseph Conrad </p>
<p>and William J. Locke. I am sure that there were no speed reading </p>
<p>courses in those days. If there had been, Mother should have taught </p>
<p>them. I never knew her to spend more than an hour reading a novel </p>
<p>and, to keep from wasting time, she was always knitting as she read. </p>
<p>It seemed to me that she would turn a page after each dozen </p>
<p>stitches. I used to make a game of reading, much more slowly, the </p>
<p>same books and trying (by what I hoped was clever questioning) to </p>
<p>find some detail she had missed. The invariable result was that she </p>
<p>had not only appreciated everything that I found, but also learned a </p>
<p>few things that I had not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mother 17</p>
<p>I should mention "The Skimmers" as it was a book club that might </p>
<p>well have been more widely imitated. I believe that Mother and </p>
<p>Professor Stevens were among its founders in the 1890s. The club </p>
<p>consisted of forty families and was divided, for convenience, into </p>
<p>eight groups of five near neighbors. During the summer, a selection </p>
<p>committee would buy forty new books of current interest. In the </p>
<p>fall, each book was kept by a family for a week and then passed on </p>
<p>to the next family on the list. On every fifth Monday I (as a child </p>
<p>of a group leader) would collect the five books in the group and </p>
<p>take them to the next group leader, and also distribute the five </p>
<p>books that were passed to us. At the end of the college year, each </p>
<p>family had read, or at least had had access to, all forty books. The </p>
<p>year ended with a party and an auction at which the books were sold, </p>
<p>usually for about half of the purchase price. Thus, unless one </p>
<p>wished to buy some of the books to keep, the cost for reading all </p>
<p>forty was about half the price of the average book, or a dollar or </p>
<p>so. The list of subscribers and groups was kept on a bookplate in </p>
<p>each book, so that the sequence was available to all. The bookplate </p>
<p>was charming and I am sorry I do not know who drew the decorated </p>
<p>heading. It gave the name "The Skimmers", supported by a milkmaid on </p>
<p>one side and a cat with a bowl of cream on the other. Occasionally </p>
<p>someone would fail to pass on a book on Monday, so that it was </p>
<p>necessary for a child to go to extract it, but in general there was </p>
<p>little difficulty of this kind. The club was still operating when I </p>
<p>left Orono in 1933, and I still miss it.</p>
<p>Mother's cataracts, of course, ultimately brought her reading to an </p>
<p>end. One eye was finally operated on, but not too successfully. In </p>
<p>her last few years, she could read the spots on a deck of cards but </p>
<p>not much else. As a result she spent most of her time playing </p>
<p>solitaire. I think she once claimed that she knew 140 different </p>
<p>games. When I was available, we played thousands of games of </p>
<p>cribbage. This was her favorite and worked very well as I could do </p>
<p>the pegging for both of us. She was also very fond of Russian Bank, </p>
<p>but I never mastered its intricacies well enough to give her a </p>
<p>stimulating game.</p>
<p>Mother suffered severely from diabetes which greatly reduced her </p>
<p>weight from what it had been in her happily married days. I do not </p>
<p>think that she ever admitted this illness perhaps because, although </p>
<p>insulin had been discovered before she died, there was no real </p>
<p>treatment for the disease available in Orono. I, at least, only </p>
<p>learned the nature of her trouble at the time of her final illness, </p>
<p>which fortunately did not last long.</p>
<p>My grief at remembering Mother comes largely from having known her </p>
<p>only at this dull and uninteresting end of a life that must have </p>
<p>begun in, for its era, a very exciting and stimulating way. </p>
<p>Fortunately, after I had been away for much of the time for four </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mother / Sister 15 18</p>
<p>years, I, with my first wife and Mother's first grandchild, was back </p>

<p>The most distinct is an occasion when I was guest of honor (or, more </p>

<p>miniature tea set, at a little table on our front porch. I remember </p>
<p>that there was a total of four at the party, and I like to think </p>

<p>When I was four years old, Mother took me on a winter and spring </p>
<p>trip to visit various relatives, but I remember only a few </p>
<p>vignettes. My only recollection of this first visit to Cambridge </p>
<p>where Uncle Merritt was Professor of Botany, is of falling out of </p>
<p>the strange bed and rolling under it, thereby creating something of </p>
<p>a furor. In New York (where Uncle Rex was an executive of the Ginn </p>
<p>and Company publishing house and therefore the source of many fine </p>
<p>boys' books while I was growing up) I have a clear recollection of </p>
<p>playing in the park on River side Drive, close to the Soldiers' and </p>
<p>Sailors' Monument, and watching the ships in the Hudson River. I </p>
<p>also remember a very pretty scene, at the old Hippodrome, where a </p>
<p>complete sailboat rose slowly from the water in the stage pool, with </p>
<p>a number of bathing beauties clinging to the rigging.</p>
<p>We must have spent some time in Chicago, for I had my only taste of </p>
<p>Kindergarten there, and I remember seeing a tremendous sea turtle in </p>
<p>the Field Museum, as well as a giraffe most of which was on the </p>
<p>first floor but whose head extended up through a hole and could be </p>
<p>seen in an upstairs gallery. This must also have been the museum in </p>
<p>which I saw the walrus and asked for the carpenter. In Chicago we </p>
<p>were visiting two maiden sisters of my father, Mary, a </p>
<p>schoolteacher, and Imogene Pierce, who was the longtime secretary of </p>
<p>the Poetry League of America, or of some other institution with a </p>
<p>similar name. At Wausau, Wisconsin, we visited Aunt "Allie" Edmonds, </p>
<p>her husband, and my only paternal cousins. My only recollection </p>
<p>there is of wading and sailing a toy boat in a flooded area that </p>
<p>should have been part of the vegetable garden.</p>
<p>I remember very little of my early school years, except that I never </p>
<p>learned to write well. I was naturally left handed, at least in </p>
<p>writing, and I grew up in an unfortunate era when teachers could not </p>
<p>decide whether to convert me or leave me alone. The problem seemed </p>
<p>to be a matter of local option in each grade and, in the various </p>
<p>years, I was changed back and forth too much. I can at least testify </p>
<p>that left handed Palmer Method is a total failure.</p>
<p>I was supposed to be "delicate" and I surely did have more chest </p>
<p>colds and fevers than most of my friends. I recall several weeks in </p>
<p>a dark room when I had the measles. Fortunately this happened at </p>
<p>Christmas and sympathy with my being sick at that time brought forth </p>
<p>an unusual number of presents. It was arranged that every hour </p>
<p>Mother would bring in a clothesbasket of wrapped gifts. I could </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Toys">Toys and Such</b> </a>20</p>
<p>select one if I either took my medicine or drank a glass of milk. </p>
<p>The basket was replenished regularly and remained full, I think, for </p>
<p>my entire period of convalescence.</p>
<p>I had a protracted illness when I was in the fifth grade. I do not </p>
<p>believe that it was especially serious, but I am sure that Mother </p>
<p>and Grandma worried about rheumatic fever., In any case, I was kept </p>
<p>at home for two or three months and my school assignments were </p>
<p>brought to me. The studies went so well that I was encouraged to </p>
<p>skip a grade when I went back to school. This I still regard as a </p>
<p>serious mistake, for it brought me to college at too early an age, </p>
<p>when I was not ready to take full advantage of the opportunities. It </p>
<p>was an easy error to make as, growing up in a highly literate </p>
<p>family, I had learned to read before I started school and never </p>
<p>found my studies very difficult. My best lessons, outside of the </p>
<p>home, probably came from roaming the woods and fields, building toy </p>
<p>boats and kites, and helping friends who had the luck to live on a </p>
<p>farm. My finest boat was probably an alleged model of the America's </p>
<p>Cup defender "Resolute". My toy took to the name so well that on her </p>
<p>maiden voyage she sailed so straight and so sturdily up the river </p>
<p>that I never saw her again. At least she was a beautiful sight as </p>
<p>she disappeared in the distance.</p>
<p>The kite I remember best was related to the "Resolute". I made </p>
<p>mostly tailless bow kites, but this one was an old-fashioned </p>
<p>hexagonal model about eight feet tall and covered with brown </p>
<p>wrapping paper because I could find nothing else in large enough </p>
<p>sheets. I had to borrow a neighbor's barn floor to assemble it and </p>
<p>enlist a pair of friends to help fly it. After it had towed us </p>
<p>across two or three fields, with some damage to us at the </p>
<p>intervening barbedwire fences, we finally had to tie it to a fence </p>
<p>post as we could not assemble enough boypower to get it down. It </p>
<p>flew from the fence post for three days before it finally carried </p>
<p>away and disappeared during the night.</p>
<p>I soon developed a knack for originating toys that had some local </p>
<p>popularity. The earliest was probably a line of toy boats, and even </p>
<p>submarines, with rubber bands for power and with propellers cut out </p>
<p>of old tin cans. These, in general, were much more successful than </p>
<p>my attempts at model airplanes, and were widely imitated. A more </p>
<p>lethal device was a slingshot mounted on a narrow board with a </p>
<p>trigger mechanism and sights. Since this separated the problems of </p>
<p>stretching and aiming, it had excellent accuracy, especially when we </p>
<p>could find a supply of buckshot or steel balls for ammunition. One </p>
<p>of my friends who built an especially powerful version of this </p>
<p>weapon claimed that he saw a bird fly into a bush a quarter of a </p>
<p>mile away. He said that he let fly at the bush and killed the bird, </p>
<p>but he was recognized as the most stalwart liar in the gang.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toys and Such 21</p>
<p>Another exaggerated toy was a broadbladed propeller launched from a </p>
<p>string wrapped spool. Our version was made of heavy gauge galvanized </p>
<p>iron that we found somewhere. These devices were a foot or so in </p>
<p>diameter and could fly 200 yards and still out a swath a dozen yards </p>
<p>long in a hayfield when they came down. Another unlikely toy was a </p>
<p>dart half an inch in diameter and twelve or fifteen inches long, </p>
<p>feathered like an arrow and with a darning needle inserted in its </p>
<p>nose. These could be thrown a hundred feet or more but with dubious </p>
<p>accuracy. Strangely, I can not recall any one being seriously </p>
<p>injured by any of these gadgets. Possibly providence takes special </p>
<p>care of children and fools when they are combined in the same </p>
<p>individuals.</p>
<p>One of my close friends, geographically as well as emotionally, was </p>
<p>Sam Clark. Sam was, in one era, cursed with having to come home from </p>
<p>whatever we were doing at 4:OO P.M. to feed a dozen or two of hens. </p>
<p>We never found out why the hens needed their food at four rather </p>
<p>than at some convenient time, but this fact forced us to devise an </p>
<p>electrical solution to the problem. We hung a board, pivoted at one </p>
<p>edge, along the roof of the small henhouse, with the other edge </p>
<p>supported by a catch that could be tripped by a solenoid. The </p>
<p>solenoid was actuated by a battery connected through the hands of an </p>
<p>old Ingersoll dollar watch set, of course, to trigger at four </p>
<p>o'clock. We could then arrange the feed for the hens along the board </p>
<p>so that it would drop into the middle of the floor at the required </p>
<p>time. We thought this was wonderful, but Sam's father vetoed the </p>
<p>idea because the food was supposed to be mixed with the chips on the </p>
<p>floor so that the hens would have to scratch for their meal. This </p>
<p>ruling required another burst of invention. We placed another wide </p>
<p>board against one wall of the hen house. This extended parallel to </p>
<p>the floor, which it almost touched, and was hinged at the top edge. </p>
<p>An arm, fixed to the board, extended horizontally out through a slot </p>
<p>in the wall. Fortunately that side of the hen house was supported on </p>
<p>posts and was several feet above the ground. We could then attach a </p>
<p>heavy weight (supported by another trigger mechanism we had linked </p>
<p>to the first board) through a rope several feet long to the outboard </p>
<p>end of the lever arm. Thus, when the food was dropped in the hen </p>
<p>house the weight also dropped but had farther to go than did the </p>
<p>food. The net result was that the food reached the floor and was </p>
<p>immediately covered by a flying cloud of chips that been piled </p>
<p>against the board along the wall. This device passed inspection by </p>
<p>Sam's father, but unfortunately the problem of reliability raised </p>
<p>its head within a few days. The heavy current for the solenoid </p>
<p>burned the hands off the watch and, since we could not afford </p>
<p>another watch and no one seemed to have an alarm clock that was not </p>
<p>needed, the experiment came to an untimely end. </p>
<p>My most enduring interest was radio, beginning when Harold Hamlin </p>
<p>let me listen to signals on a set he had made in 1916 or 1917. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Radio">Beginning with Radio</b> </a>22</p>
<p>Thereafter I was always trying to make a receiver that would work. </p>
<p>There was, of course, no money for any such foolishness so my coils </p>
<p>were, at first, the traditional Quaker Oats boxes wound with wire </p>
<p>taken from abandoned Ford Model T spark coils. I tried many kinds of </p>
<p>detectors, none very successfully (partly, of course, because few </p>
<p>stations were audible in Maine before 1920). Fortunately our upright </p>
<p>telephone had the old fashioned receiver with exposed binding posts. </p>
<p>I could disconnect it and take it upstairs to try to detect a </p>
<p>signal, but had to be careful to hear the telephone if it rang so </p>
<p>that I could get the receiver back before Grandma tried to answer </p>
<p>the call. My explosive descents of the stairs with the receiver </p>
<p>eventually called attention to what was going on, and after a few </p>
<p>months (when it was clear that my interest had not subsided) money </p>
<p>was found for a secondhand set of head phones.</p>
<p>I somehow induced the old Federal Radio Commission to grant me an </p>
<p>amateur transmitting license before I was thirteen. This did not </p>
<p>really do much for me for two or three years, but by 1923 I had </p>
<p>amassed a little equipment that really worked. Between then and 1927 </p>
<p>I was fairly active, making the "brasspounder's league" occasionally </p>
<p>by relaying a considerable number of messages and engaging in a </p>
<p>little of the excitement of the first amateur transatlantic </p>
<p>communications. I surely wasted far too much time and money on </p>
<p>amateur radio before I first left Orono, but I feel that it taught </p>
<p>me some interesting and probably useful things. </p>
<p>I had had to wear glasses to correct astigmatism from the time when </p>
<p>I was seven or eight years old. In those days, this alone </p>
<p>disqualified me for most sports. As a result, tennis was the only </p>
<p>sport I ever became at all proficient in, and I gave that up at </p>
<p>about twenty after a shoulder dislocation made it impossible to play </p>
<p>for a couple of years. Before I "retired" I became able to brag of </p>
<p>having played a set with Big Bill Tilden, the most famous player of </p>
<p>the era, who happened to visit the wealthy family of a friend. </p>
<p>Through Mr. Tilden's kindness, I won one game. I fenced for a year </p>
<p>in college finding, oddly, that the foil felt more natural to my </p>
<p>left hand although my tennis was righthanded. I had a pair of skis, </p>
<p>left over from an uncle, and spent much time on them. It was chiefly </p>
<p>cross country skiing, although I did steal some practice on the </p>
<p>college ski jump.</p>
<p>Through my high school years I had, like Tom Sawyer, a way of </p>
<p>getting out at night without disturbing my family. Mine was over a </p>
<p>shed roof and down an antenna pole. It was a great joy when I </p>
<p>discovered that I could climb up the outside of the little college </p>
<p>observatory, open the slide in the roof, and get in. Thereafter I </p>
<p>spent most of many nights there becoming fairly proficient at using </p>
<p>the telescope, although I really never did anything very useful with </p>
<p>it. Curiously, no one ever disturbed me at this practice. I have </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Schooling">Schooling</b> </a>23</p>
<p>often wondered what, if anything, my family (or anyone else except </p>
<p>the occasional boy I took with me) may have known about it.</p>
<p>High School itself seems to have left very few noteworthy </p>
<p>impressions. I took the "classical" course with all the math and </p>
<p>science (except biology) I could get. I had four years of Latin and </p>
<p>three of French, neither of which has stood by me very well. At </p>
<p>least the inscriptional Latin I find on various walls at Harvard </p>
<p>seems to be a closed book to me, and although I read French well </p>
<p>enough for my scientific purposes I have never been able to maintain </p>
<p>a conversation in it. I feel sure that I knew more Physics than my </p>
<p>teachers, and probably made that fact evident, but they never seemed </p>
<p>to resent it.</p>
<p>One episode in High School amused me greatly at the time although I </p>
<p>have since become less proud of it. In our senior year one of the </p>
<p>major assignments in English was a composition in fictional form. </p>
<p>This seemed to terrify the ten or twelve others in the class. Being </p>
<p>goodnatured, or soft, I agreed to help someone and the news spread. </p>
<p>The result was that I eventually wrote all of the dozen stories </p>
<p>myself, varying the subject matter, style, and even orthography in </p>
<p>accordance with my estimates of my comrades' abilities. The effort </p>
<p>seemed to be successful, as everyone received about his normal grade </p>
<p>on the composition. Two of the best were, I think, used in the </p>
<p>school yearbook, and I never heard of any repercussions from the </p>
<p>management.</p>
<p>I was, as tacitly insisted upon by my family, class valedictorian. I </p>
<p>seem to remember that my speech must have been in the best </p>
<p>nineteenth century tradition, and I am sorry that I do not have a </p>
<p>copy of it. It would today, I am sure, be supremely funny. This last </p>
<p>minor triumph marked the end of the period when all my studies were </p>
<p>easy for me. Henceforth, it would be necessary to do more studying. </p>
<p>My well formed superiority complex actually lasted just a little </p>
<p>longer. Maine had recently adopted the "Freshman Week" idea, and I </p>
<p>took a number of placement exams in the hope of being excused from </p>
<p>freshman courses or at least of being assigned to advanced sections </p>
<p>of them. I remember receiving the highest score in the class in the </p>
<p>general intelligence test I think it was the old Army Alpha but this </p>
<p>did not please me as much as the results of my exams in English and </p>
<p>Math. In the Math I found everything relatively easy except for a </p>
<p>mental block that prevented my seeing how to attack the proposition </p>
<p>that two triangles are equal if the three sides of one are equal to </p>
<p>the three sides of the other. I left a blank page until I had </p>
<p>finished the rest of the exam, and then went, back with no relief </p>
<p>from the block. In some agony I wrote the first equation or two and </p>
<p>put down the correct final statement with several blank lines in </p>
<p>between. At the end of the examination period I quickly filled in </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="College">College and Troubles </a>24</p>
<p>several statements of identity that may or may not have had anything </p>
<p>to do with the problem, and wrote "Q.E.D." at the end. The English </p>
<p>exam was primarily composition under an assigned title. At the </p>
<p>moment I could produce nothing whatever except a love story that was </p>
<p>as torrid as could be put on paper in Maine in 1924. Both efforts </p>
<p>were successful, as I was admitted to Sophomore classes. I never </p>
<p>heard anything about the Mathematics but an English instructor later </p>
<p>told me that I was admitted to advanced standing not because of my </p>
<p>ability in composition but "because of my emotional maturity" a joke </p>
<p>if I ever heard one. In retrospect, of course, I realize that none </p>
<p>of these results could have been good for me. I would probably have </p>
<p>been better off if Freshman Week had not been invented until later, </p>
<p>and I had been allowed more time to mature and to think as I </p>
<p>progressed.</p>
<p>My freshman year in college went reasonably well. My grades were not </p>
<p>as high as they had been in high school but were quite satisfactory. </p>
<p>I do not believe that tennis could have been recognized as a sport </p>
<p>because, to avoid Physical Training, I tried to shoot on the </p>
<p>freshman rifle team and to run cross-country. In neither enterprise </p>
<p>did I enjoy conspicuous success. My cross-country was especially </p>
<p>discouraging because I would come in after my usual 30 or 31 minutes </p>
<p>and find that Ernie Ridlon, who was, I think, about to become ICAAAA </p>
<p>champion, had not only showered but might have gotten fully dressed </p>
<p>while I was laboring through the last half mile.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1925 I had an odd accident. While walking with a </p>
<p>friend one Sunday afternoon, he called my attention to something </p>
<p>unusual about the construction of a small culvert beside a telephone </p>
<p>pole. I swung around to the far side of the pole and collided with a </p>
<p>climber's spike that was set much too low on the pole. The </p>
<p>relatively sharp edge on the head of the spike caught me just at the </p>
<p>hair line. The wound bled copiously, ruining the best pair of white </p>
<p>flannel trousers I ever had, but otherwise seemed to do no great </p>
<p>damage. A few days later, however, I began to develop severe </p>
<p>headaches. I soon found that if I were exercising somewhat </p>
<p>strenuously I might have blank periods when I could not remember </p>
<p>what I had been doing for half an hour or more. These symptoms </p>
<p>brought my summer activities to an almost complete stop. The only </p>
<p>medical advice seemed to be "rest", so I did nothing memorable until </p>
<p>college opened in the fall. This started well but after a few weeks </p>
<p>I found that an hour's study would blur my vision until the words on </p>
<p>a printed page might completely disappear. This effect, with the </p>
<p>accompanying headaches, made college an impossibility, so I dropped </p>
<p>out after a few weeks of my sophomore year. </p>
<p>For a while, in the winter, I found a job sorting dowels in a small </p>
<p>woodworking mill in western Maine (at $12.00 for a forty-eight hour </p>
<p>week) but I was called back from this because Grandma had a serious </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Accident">More About My "Small" Accident</b> </a>25</p>
<p>attack of pneumonia. She surprised everyone by recovering, and I </p>
<p>stayed at home the rest of the spring and summer doing practically </p>
<p>nothing. </p>
<p>I tried college again the next fall, with much the same result as in </p>
<p>the previous year, except that the serious symptoms were slower in </p>
<p>developing. I think I lasted until December, this time. It was </p>
<p>obvious that I had to find an outdoor job, or at least one that did </p>
<p>not require much close eyesight. Grandma found me a place through </p>
<p>one of her friends among the Maine alumni, who was in charge of a </p>
<p>valuation survey for the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad. </p>
<p>As a result I reported in March, 1927, to a field group that was </p>
<p>working in New Haven, Connecticut. </p>
</font><p><hr>
<font face="Courier New" size="2"><p>4. </p>
<b><p><a name="Railroad">The New Haven Railroad </a></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that the Interstate Commerce Commission had finally forced </p>
<p>the railroad to make a complete physical inventory of its property, </p>
<p>including a number of street railway companies in Connecticut and </p>
<p>Massachusetts. I found myself to be a chainman in a survey group </p>
<p>that was beginning work on the Connecticut Company. This started by </p>
<p>measuring the lengths of the tracks, then estimating the weights of </p>
<p>rails, the number of ties, the amounts of steel and concrete in </p>
<p>bridges, and so on. The job was to operate one end of a hundred-foot </p>
<p>steel tape, always holding it accurately against a mark and applying </p>
<p>what was supposed to be a fourteen pound pull, for mile after mile </p>
<p>through the city streets and out to the end of each trolley line. </p>
<p>For this, I was paid $27.57 per week plus an allowance of $18.00 a </p>
<p>week for living expenses, as the group was theoretically based in </p>
<p>Boston. This was real luxury because one could live easily on the </p>
<p>$27.57 while the expense money was paid monthly. Thus, in the first </p>
<p>week of each month there was nearly a hundred dollars ready to be </p>
<p>blown. I remember well one of the first times this happened. Page </p>
<p>Sanderson, my closest new friend and later roommate, and I decided </p>
<p>to see Coney Island. We went down after work ended at noon on </p>
<p>Saturday and went through the amusement park in complete detail. If </p>
<p>the next concession was a game we played it, or if it was food we </p>
<p>ate it. The enterprise took until about sunrise and cost us (ten or </p>
<p>fifteen cents at a time) over a hundred dollars each. Somehow we got </p>
<p>home again before we collapsed, and I think we were able to report </p>
<p>for work on Monday. I have never, to tell the truth, cared much for </p>
<p>an amusement park since then.</p>
<p>One of the perquisites of this job was an all-station pass on the </p>
<p>railroad. These were rare, but were granted to us because, in </p>
<p>theory, there was no telling where we might be assigned next. Thus </p>
<p>we could freely roam between Boston and New York whenever time </p>
<p>permitted; and, at twenty years of age, time permitted quite a lot. </p>
<p>The "white" all station pass was very powerful, perhaps because </p>
<p>conductors tended to think that the youngsters who carried them had </p>
<p>to be relatives of directors of the railroad. The passes even worked </p>
<p>fairly reliably on other roads than the New Haven. The technique was </p>
<p>to display the pass prominently in a billfold from which one </p>
<p>halfheartedly offered to extract money to pay a cash fare. About </p>
<p>four times out of five the conductor would pass on to the next </p>
<p>passenger. Much the same thing would happen if one wished to take a </p>
<p>girl with him. The conductor would seldom collect for the girl's </p>
<p>fare, especially if she could be induced to wear a Woolworth wedding </p>
<p>ring. This pass meant that I could go to Boston or New York very </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The New Haven Railroad 27</p>
<p>frequently and could often visit Mother and Grandma in Orono at </p>
<p>little or no cost, unless I were in funds and chose to go by </p>
<p>Pullman. It was, I seem to recall, seldom that I spent a weekend in </p>
<p>New Haven. </p>
<p>In Bridgeport I barely escaped a serious accident. We were surveying </p>
<p>an area where the railroad viaduct crossed over a street that had </p>
<p>trolley tracks. We needed to find the intersection of the </p>
<p>centerlines and determine the angle between them. Because there were </p>
<p>four busy railroad tracks we tried to work rapidly on the viaduct, </p>
<p>which led to my taking notes in a book on my knee while holding one </p>
<p>end of a steel tape. To keep the tape tight with one hand, I found </p>
<p>myself squatting in the depression between tracks and steadying the </p>
<p>hand holding the tape against the nearest rail. Because a long </p>
<p>freight train was thundering by on the furthest track, I failed to </p>
<p>hear the approach of a fast passenger train on the track against </p>
<p>which I was leaning. The first I knew of its presence was when the </p>
<p>cylinder of the locomotive knocked my hat off while the wheels </p>
<p>skinned three knuckles of the hand against the rail. I had no time </p>
<p>to be frightened but the others in the group, who had heard the </p>
<p>locomotive whistling at me and had been shouting warnings I did not </p>
<p>hear, were all in bad shape. The boss of the crew, Mr. Byron Nelson, </p>
<p>from a vantage point fifty yards away, had seen the situation </p>
<p>developing and claimed that he had had time enough to start drafting </p>
<p>a letter of condolence to my family. He, I think, sustained such an </p>
<p>emotional shock that he was unable to work for a day or two.</p>
<p>It was also in Bridgeport that I had the most instantaneous surprise </p>
<p>I ever had. Some trolley tracks ran through the yard of an abandoned </p>
<p>power plant at the edge of the harbor, and one or two tracks </p>
<p>extended into the building. At this time I was taking notes with two </p>
<p>of the other boys surveying for me. After an hour or more of writing </p>
<p>in the notebook in the brilliant sunshine, we went into the building </p>
<p>to see what tracks were inside. I was almost blind in the dim light. </p>
<p>One of my friends followed the caretaker and I followed a few yards </p>
<p>behind him, able to see only his white shirt. I realized later that </p>
<p>he had walked down the center of a large room and then turned to go </p>
<p>through a door at a corner. I suppose I unconsciously turned toward </p>
<p>the door too soon. Whatever the reason, at one instant I was walking </p>
<p>quietly on a solid cement floor and at the next I found myself </p>
<p>submerged in a foul tasting viscous pool. One good stroke with the </p>
<p>notebook brought me to the surface and my friends pulled me out in a </p>
<p>highly bedraggled condition. I then found that the large room </p>
<p>consisted mostly of two large pits that had previously underlain </p>
<p>engines and generators and that were now full of a mixture of old </p>
<p>engine oil and sea water. My "solid cement floor" was actually only </p>
<p>a catwalk between the pits. This episode did me no harm except to </p>
<p>ruin my clothes and keep me washing stains out of my hair for a day </p>
<p>or two. I had to launder my money before the bank would exchange it, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The New Haven Railroad 28</p>
<p>and fortunately the railroad bought me a new suit.</p>
<p>Near this old power plant was the yard where I had a chance to climb </p>
<p>over and through the "Nautilus". This was one of Simon Lake's early </p>
<p>submarines that had been acquired and modified by Sir Hubert Wilkins </p>
<p>for his abortive effort to reach the North Pole under the ice. I was </p>
<p>fascinated by some of Sir Hubert's devices, especially wheels that </p>
<p>would permit the submarine to creep along the bottom, and air locks </p>
<p>through which divers could get out to explore the environment, </p>
<p>exactly as in "Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea". </p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I witnessed a very touching sight in 1930, when I was working in the </p>
<p>old South Station office building in Boston. In that year the </p>
<p>American Legion, then at the height of its numbers and enthusiasm, </p>
<p>held its national convention in Boston, highlighted by a great </p>
<p>parade. I walked up Summer Street in time to watch the beginning of </p>
<p>this. There was some delay in getting the cars for the dignitaries </p>
<p>properly organized, so an Army regiment was sent ahead, apparently </p>
<p>to give the crowd something to watch. This group was then formed </p>
<p>into a long line along the curb to allow the dignitaries to pass by, </p>
<p>and it happened that I found myself on the sidewalk just opposite </p>
<p>the colors. After a time the cars began to come past but again some </p>
<p>delay occurred up ahead. This forced the open car bearing General </p>
<p>Pershing and General Giraud, a French World War I hero, to stop </p>
<p>exactly in front of me. The generals had, of course, interrupted </p>
<p>their conversation to salute the colors just as the car stopped. I </p>
<p>was greatly impressed to see that the two old gentlemen held their </p>
<p>salutes, without the faintest sign of surprise or irritation, for </p>
<p>ten or fifteen minutes. When the car started again the generals </p>
<p>terminated their salutes and turned toward each other to resume </p>
<p>their talk. Ever since this sight I have felt it imcumbent upon me </p>
<p>to be meticulous in saluting the flag whenever I watch a parade.</p>
</font><p align="CENTER"><a name="Pershing"></p>

<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p>General Pershing </a></p>
</b><p>In all, I spent somewhat more than four years working for the </p>
<p>railroad: one year in New Haven, one divided between Bridgeport and </p>
<p>Hartford, one in Boston, and a final one back in New Haven. As my </p>
<p>eyes gradually improved, I was promoted through the ranks of Rodman </p>
<p>and Computer to Recorder. The first two years required primarily </p>
<p>outdoor work but after that there was more and more done at the </p>
<p>desk. I became a skillful comptometer operator and for a long time </p>
<p>preferred the comptometer to an electronic calculator for some </p>
<p>operations. In 1930, as the depression deepened, I was notified of </p>
<p>my discharge. This did not actually take place for a rather </p>
<p>depressing reason. On what was supposed to be my last day I went to </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>General Pershing 29</p>
<p>the office to clear out my desk and found that one of the draftsmen, </p>
<p>depressed by investment worries, had committed suicide the night </p>
<p>before. Because I had had an excellent course in mechanical drawing </p>
<p>in high school, I did not hesitate to accept the management's </p>
<p>decision to convert me into a draftsman. Perhaps the financial </p>
<p>emergency became less acute, or perhaps my drawing was not very </p>
<p>good. In any case, after two or three months I found myself doing </p>
<p>about what I had done before.</p>
<p>Through a friend I had met in my freshman year at college, who had </p>
<p>dropped out and was working in the Boston area, I had met, in 1927, </p>
<p>Marion Rogers of Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Thereafter I used my </p>
<p>railroad pass frequently for trips to Providence. We were married in </p>
<p>early 1929, stimulation that meant a great deal to me. A daughter, </p>
<p>Martha Jane, was born in 1930 and did much to keep her parents </p>
<p>together. </p>

<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p>End of My Work for the Railroad</p>
</b><p>During my last year with the railroad, I lived with my small family </p>
<p>in West Haven, Connecticut. One of my clearest evidences of single-</p>
<p>mindedness or possibly of some less desirable characteristic comes </p>
<p>from this period. When Marion and I required a babysitter, our usual </p>
<p>one was a schoolgirl named Marian Bergeron who lived a few blocks </p>
<p>away. When we got back from a movie, it was my duty to walk home </p>
<p>with the sitter. This, I remember, I regarded as a nuisance, and I </p>
<p>am sure I never noticed the girl except as a convenience to whom we </p>
<p>paid small fees from time to time. My lack of normal male powers of </p>
<p>observation was revealed, a year after we left West Haven, when our </p>
<p>former baby sitter went to Atlantic City and became Miss America.</p>
<p>In 1930 and early 1931, my remaining symptoms of eye trouble cleared </p>
<p>up completely and quickly. It was easy to tell, after the fact, that </p>
<p>a blood clot had finally dissolved. This brought an intense desire </p>
<p>to finish my college courses, so in 1931 I left the railroad and </p>
<p>returned to Orono. The college career had another setback when a </p>
<p>major attack of quinsy kept me out of school for three months in the </p>
<p>fall of 1931. I had to drop part of my courses, and from then on it </p>
<p>was a question whet her the two years I had budgeted for, with my </p>
<p>meager savings and a thousand dollars I had borrowed from Mother, </p>
<p>would be enough to let me earn the necessary credits. The financial </p>
<p>situation grew worse with Mother's death in 1932, as she was able to </p>
<p>leave me almost nothing beyond the money I had borrowed. I finally </p>
<p>came to the end of that money and the little I had been able to </p>
<p>borrow from other sources, with about ten semester hours still </p>
<p>lacking. Throughout this period my wife declined to help by finding </p>
<p>a job or, so far as I can recall, by doing anything to make my tasks </p>
<p>easier. Her main interest in this period was in playing a great deal </p>
<p>of contract bridge, part of which required an amount of my time that </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>End of My Work for the Railroad 30</p>
<p>might better have been spent in study. This was the beginning of my </p>
<p>realization of a "law" I have often tried to teach my graduate </p>
<p>students and others: that a married man can successfully pursue his </p>
<p>studies only if his wife desires the degree at least as much as he </p>
<p>does himself.</p>
<p>I tried very hard to get some kind of a job at the University of </p>
<p>Maine, for I felt a great deal of loyalty to it, but President Hauck </p>
<p>took no interest in my hopes. The depression was at its worst and I </p>
<p>was unable to find a job anywhere. </p>

<b><p><a name="Phone">The Telephone Company</a></p>
</b><p>The friend who had introduced me to Marion had returned to western </p>
<p>Maine and had taken over a small independent telephone company. He </p>
<p>needed cheap help, so I went to work with him in 1933, receiving no </p>
<p>pay but with food and shelter provided for my family. Along with </p>
<p>acting as linesmen, telephone operators, bill collectors, and </p>
<p>whatever other servants the little company needed, we tried to </p>
<p>develop a small radio business. We sold vacuum tubes on consignment </p>
<p>and built transmitters for radio amateurs and similar things </p>
<p>whenever we could find a customer, which was not often.</p>
<p>The telephone business had its interesting aspects. In those remote </p>
<p>days, telephone operators were helpful. Especially in a small town, </p>
<p>the operator knew almost everything anyone needed to find out. Calls </p>
<p>were never placed by number. A customer would say, "I want to talk </p>
<p>to George Tibbett", and the operator would reply, "He went into the </p>
<p>feed store about fifteen minutes ago. I'll try there". The feed </p>
<p>store might answer, "No. George just left here. He said he was going </p>
<p>to ask Jim Healy about fixing his plow". A call to Jim would </p>
<p>probably provide the required communication all done in two or three </p>
<p>minutes.</p>
<p>Listening on party lines was commonplace, and often a trial to the </p>
<p>operators, especially when a long distance call came in so weakly </p>
<p>that it really could not operate several receivers. It surprised me </p>
<p>to discover that, with experience, "central" could usually tell who </p>
<p>was listening. There are, of course, different sounds in different </p>
<p>houses: clocks ticking, children crying, footsteps on bare floors, </p>
<p>and so on. One would not suppose that, with the limited sensitivity </p>
<p>and poor frequency response of a telephone circuit, these background </p>
<p>noises would make up a unique signature for each house. They do so, </p>
<p>however, usually without the operator being at all conscious of the </p>
<p>clues. It was often, though not always, possible to say firmly, </p>
<p>"Aunt Susie, get off the line!", and have the order promptly </p>
<p>followed by a bang of the receiver having all of the quality of </p>
<p>profanity.</p>
<p>The company had copper wire connecting it to Portland and Boston but </p>
<p>most of the lines, some of which extended forty miles back into the </p>
<p>country, were of iron wire which had much greater losses. I became a </p>
<p>good lineman from the exercise of my duties in removing tree limbs </p>
<p>and repairing broken wires. Some of these lines ran to hunting </p>
<p>camps. In the autumn, these camps would be full of wealthy hunters </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Repeaters">The Repeater </a>32</p>
<p>who tried to keep in touch with their New York brokers. As they </p>
<p>could seldom hear their correspondents wall enough, these calls </p>
<p>became long and confused sessions with one or more operators forced </p>
<p>to repeat messages in a jargon they did not understand. We decided </p>
<p>that we had to build a repeater. The problem with a telephone </p>
<p>repeater is to send the signal from either end of the line onward to </p>
<p>the other end of the line in amplified form, but not to send the </p>
<p>amplified signal back toward its source. </p>
<p>This is done by having two amplifiers (one for each direction) and </p>
<p>by matching the electrical impedance of each line in an artificial, </p>
<p>or "dummy", line. These elements are connected in an electrical </p>
<p>bridge so that each amplified output is balanced out to nearly zero </p>
<p>on the incoming line. Under perfect conditions, this can be done </p>
<p>with great precision. In our case the line impedance changed with </p>
<p>the temperature of the iron wire, while the leakage varied </p>
<p>tremendously depending upon how many tree branches lay across the </p>
<p>line and how wet they were. The only workable mechanism was to </p>
<p>provide some adjustments in the characteristics of the dummy lines </p>
<p>and to have a gain control that could be advanced manually as much </p>
<p>as possible without creating an oscillation, or "singing", when too </p>
<p>much amplified energy was fed back toward its source.</p>
<p>We built such a device and installed it on top of the central </p>
<p>switchboard with the gain control within comfortable reach. When two </p>
<p>subscribers had difficulty in understanding each other, we would </p>
<p>switch in the repeater and increase the gain until we could </p>
<p>recognize the hollow and slightly reverberant sound that was the </p>
<p>last stage before the system burst into oscillation. It all really </p>
<p>worked very well, providing communication under conditions that had </p>
<p>never permitted it before. Unfortunately, however, we were not able </p>
<p>to keep this device in operation very long. Most of the cases when </p>
<p>we needed it were, of course, on long distance calls. It rapidly </p>
<p>became obvious that whenever an AT&amp;T operator in Portland, Boston, </p>
<p>or even New York tipped her switch to monitor a call she spoiled our </p>
<p>delicate balance of forces and was invariably greeted by a loud </p>
<p>oscillation. We tried our best to convince the long lines department </p>
<p>that our repeater really worked very well and that everything would </p>
<p>be fine if they would only keep their operators off the line. This </p>
<p>could not be done, as we should have known, and by threatening not </p>
<p>to pay us our share of the toll charges they forced us to abandon </p>
<p>the repeater after two or three months. For at least one full </p>
<p>hunting season, however, our customers had had exceptional service.</p>
<p>One of the more powerful Maine politicians arranged to have the </p>
<p>Civilian Conservation Corps (a depression era effort to take boys </p>
<p>off the street and employ them under quasi-military conditions in </p>
<p>useful public works) build him an improved road to his hunting camp. </p>
<p>This reconstruction required us to move a quarter of a mile of </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="CCC">C. C. C. Boys</b> </a>33</p>
<p>telephone line from one side of a road to the other. It was arranged </p>
<p>that the CCC would provide the labor. On the appointed morning I met </p>
<p>the crew which, for some reason, consisted of about fifteen boys </p>
<p>from Bridgeport, Connecticut, who, it soon appeared, could not even </p>
<p>climb a pole with a ladder. I therefore set them to digging. I went </p>
<p>down the road with a shovel and turned a sod at each point where I </p>
<p>wanted one of the dozen poles to go. I told them to make the holes </p>
<p>eight feet deep, which is usually by no means easy in the rocky </p>
<p>Maine soil. I then went off to climb the poles and detach the wires </p>
<p>from the insulators, so that the poles could be taken down when the </p>
<p>time came. This kept me busy for an hour or more. When I came back </p>
<p>to the first hole I found it a thing of considerable beauty. It was </p>
<p>a full eight feet deep and had absolutely smooth sides and bottom, </p>
<p>without a loose pebble anywhere. Its only defect was that it had </p>
<p>about the proportions of a twelve quart pail and looked large enough </p>
<p>to serve as a grave for an elephant. I read the boys a lecture about </p>
<p>how a hole should be fourteen inches in diameter and again absented </p>
<p>myself for a while. When I returned I found the later holes getting </p>
<p>better and better. The last hole of all was the best, but at that </p>
<p>time it was only three or four feet deep. At that level the boys had </p>
<p>encountered a rook. Dropping a crowbar on it, could tell by the </p>
<p>sound that the only wise move would be to abandon that hole and try </p>
<p>another a few feet away. The boys were, however, all full of </p>
<p>enthusiasm for their increasing skill, so I thought their training </p>
<p>would be best improved by leaving them to their own devices. When I </p>
<p>thought it safe to come back I found a beautiful hole of the proper </p>
<p>depth and no more than eighteen inches in diameter. The only anomaly </p>
<p>was that on the surface beside the hole was a boulder of nearly the </p>
<p>size and roughly the shape of an overstuffed arm chair. To this day </p>
<p>I cannot imagine how the boys got this stone out of the hole with </p>
<p>only crowbars and shovels. Even more amazing was the repair work on </p>
<p>the hole which was perfect, the sod around it looking as though it </p>
<p>had never been disturbed. I was sure I would lose face if I enquired </p>
<p>how they had done it all, so I complimented them on the diameter of </p>
<p>the hole and we went on to finish the job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One April afternoon I acquired a totally undeserved reputation as a </p>
<p>swimmer. I had been searching for a short circuit on one of the iron </p>
<p>wire lines thirty miles from home. It happened that the line crossed </p>
<p>the Dead River (in a region now at the bottom of Flagstaff Lake) </p>
<p>midway between two bridges that were ten or twelve miles apart. I </p>
<p>made a resistance measurement in the neighborhood of the first </p>
<p>bridge and thought that the road up the eastern side of the river </p>
<p>would bring me to the location of the trouble. When I climbed a pole </p>
<p>near the river crossing I found that I had been wrong; the short was </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C. C. C. Boys 34</p>
<p>only a hundred yards away, but on the other side of the river. As it </p>
<p>was nearing sunset I was in a hurry to finish, and I hated to think </p>
<p>of the tenmile drive to either of the bridges and back on the other </p>
<p>side. The river was only a hundred feet wide and looked placid </p>
<p>enough. A sloping granite shelf extended well out into the river, </p>
<p>and I thought that I could wade across. I stripped down to my </p>
<p>undershirt but kept my trousers and lineman's climbers on, because I </p>
<p>would need them as I would my belt full of tools, and waded into the </p>
<p>river. The water was fearfully cold, as it certainly had been snow </p>
<p>until a day or so before, and was flowing at a rate that was not </p>
<p>indicated by the placid surface. By the time I had waded in up to my </p>
<p>hips, the current swept me off the rocky shelf and deposited me in a </p>
<p>deep pool. My best efforts to swim did me little good because of all </p>
<p>the weight on my legs, and the current swept me rapidly downstream. </p>
<p>As my strength was about gone, the river brought me near a large </p>
<p>rock and, by a last strenuous effort, I got close enough to catch a </p>
<p>rough spot and swing into the lee of the stone. I gasped for a </p>
<p>minute or two, and then climbed on the rock and found myself more </p>
<p>than half way across. After resting as long as the cold allowed, I </p>
<p>made my best racing dive which carried me far enough to be able to </p>
<p>wade ashore on the other side of the river. My pride then forced me </p>
<p>to climb the river bank and then the pole and fix the trouble on the </p>
<p>line. </p>
<p>While on the pole I had time to consider what to do next. The road </p>
<p>on that side of the river was very little used and the chance of </p>
<p>meeting a car before I froze seemed very remote. There was one house </p>
<p>in that region, only a hundred yards away, but it was dark and, I </p>
<p>assumed, deserted. After some thought I worked my way upstream until </p>
<p>I was a quarter of a mile above my original starting point and in an </p>
<p>area where there were no obvious rocks and whirlpools. I searched </p>
<p>the bank until I found a nice four-foot piece of dried pulpwood and </p>
<p>took it down the bank of the river. My idea was to keep the log </p>
<p>under my arm and paddle across, letting the current take me </p>
<p>downstream as far as it cared to while I conserved my strength. I </p>
<p>had neglected to notice that the river curved, and I soon discovered </p>
<p>that the bank was just as steep under water as it was above it. I </p>
<p>was almost immediately in deep water and the current set in toward </p>
<p>the bank so strongly that I was carried a couple of hundred yards </p>
<p>downstream before I could get more than five or six yards from </p>
<p>shore. As this did not seem to be getting me anywhere, I decided to </p>
<p>paddle back to the "wrong" shore and study the situation some more. </p>
<p>This, I should have realized, did not work either, because my </p>
<p>equipment and pulpwood made for very poor swimming. By the time this </p>
<p>was clear, the river had taken me down into the region where I had </p>
<p>had my original troubles and, before I realized what was happening, </p>
<p>it swept me into a whirlpool and snatched my pulpwood away from me. </p>
<p>This left me trying to swim again, but in a much worse state of cold </p>
<p>and fatigue. It wasn't long before my legs went straight down and </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="River">The Dead River</b> </a>35</p>
<p>fortunately touched a large rock. Before the current swept me off </p>
<p>this I had a moment to relax my cramping muscles and take a deep </p>
<p>breath or two. This surge of strength carried me for another </p>
<p>fraction of a minute. When my legs went down again they luckily </p>
<p>touched bottom enough to let me push myself toward the "right" shore </p>
<p>and then find that I could wade out. Back at the car, I put on all </p>
<p>the clothes I had and turned the heater up to maximum. By the time I </p>
<p>had driven to the nearest village, my teeth did not chatter too much </p>
<p>and I was. beginning to believe that I might not freeze to death. My </p>
<p>pride driving me again, I went into the general store to carry out </p>
<p>the usual routine of telephoning headquarters to report the trouble </p>
<p>cleared, and to enjoy the heat from the potbellied stove that was </p>
<p>fortunately running at dull red heat. The loafers sitting around the </p>
<p>stove of course showed some curiosity as I came in dripping. I </p>
<p>explained, as casually as I could, that I had just swum across the </p>
<p>Dead River to fix a fault on the other side. This claim was greeted </p>
<p>by a chorus of guffaws, as everyone knew that nobody could swim the </p>
<p>river during the spring flood. I stayed in the store long enough to </p>
<p>get warm again, holding up my end as well as I could in a battle of </p>
<p>facetious comments, and then went home for a late dinner. </p>
<p>Fortunately for my reputation, it turned out that an old man was </p>
<p>living in the house I had thought deserted. He had seen me come up </p>
<p>over the river bank to fix the line and then go back into the river. </p>
<p>He reported this at the general store the next day, and my local </p>
<p>status gained immeasurably from his verification of my story. </p>
<p>There was one much more painful episode when I was repairing a line. </p>
<p>I had climbed a rather short pole and had just driven my spikes in </p>
<p>firmly and attached my safety belt when I was attacked by a cloud of </p>
<p>hornets. Because my feet were not more than three or four yards </p>
<p>above the ground, I simply cast off my belt and jumped and, I </p>
<p>believe, was running by the time I hit the ground. Despite my speedy </p>
<p>reaction, I received thirty-five or forty stings and was sick enough </p>
<p>to stay in bed for a few days. Later investigation revealed a half-</p>
<p>bushel sized paper nest hanging from a pine branch just above the </p>
<p>pole, and also a colony of carpenter wasps living in the pole, with </p>
<p>their entrance on the side I had not seen when I climbed.</p>
<p>We had some interesting times trying to convince the Maine State </p>
<p>Forestry Department that they should use UHF radio for communication </p>
<p>between fire towers. In those days, the telephone lines to the </p>
<p>towers consisted of twisted pair dragged up through the woods; </p>
<p>generally neither on the ground nor far above it. Whenever a tree </p>
<p>fell or a bear or moose passed by, the line was likely to be broken, </p>
<p>and repairs were, of course, very laborious and time consuming. We </p>
<p>thought that the amateur five meter band offered excellent prospects </p>
<p>for a demonstration of improved service, so we built two or three </p>
<p>transmitters and receivers and carried them up various mountains; </p>
<p>most often Mount Bigelow, which was conspicuous beside the Arnold </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Firetower">Radios for the Fire Towers</b> </a>36</p>
<p>Trail. This mountain was named for one of Arnold's officers who </p>
<p>allegedly climbed it to see if he could see Quebec, but one is </p>
<p>inclined to think that maps must have been better than that, even in </p>
<p>Revolutionary days.</p>
<p>The fire wardens dearly loved our radios, and would chat with each </p>
<p>other by the hour at a high cost to us in the labor of carrying </p>
<p>fresh batteries up to them, but we never succeeded in getting the </p>
<p>State to buy any radios. This was a fine example of the difficulties </p>
<p>inherent in trying to implement a good idea before the world is </p>
<p>ready for it. In any case, we got plenty of exercise carrying </p>
<p>seventy or eighty pound packs of equipment and batteries up </p>
<p>mountains. This usually involved about three hours of strenuous </p>
<p>climbing, after walking perhaps as far as ten miles to get to the </p>
<p>base of the mountain.</p>
<p>Early in this enterprise I was surprised to make contact, while on </p>
<p>Mount Bigelow, with an amateur station operated equally temporarily </p>
<p>on Mount Cadillac near Bar Harbor. This station belonged to Mr. </p>
<p>Henry S. Shaw who, I found later, was the cofounder and Treasurer of </p>
<p>the General Radio Company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and who had a </p>
<p>summer home in Maine. Mr. Shaw was a dilettante experimenter, very </p>
<p>much interested in the new ultra high frequencies, and we were both </p>
<p>excited about the relatively long range at which we had communicated </p>
<p>some thing approaching a hundred and twenty miles. I perhaps had </p>
<p>spoken to Mr. Shaw once or twice more by radio in the course of our </p>
<p>experiments, and I once met him briefly at a gathering of amateur </p>
<p>radio operators in Bar Harbor. These contacts, casual as they were, </p>
<p>would have a powerful effect upon my future.</p>
<p>Among the dozens of importunate letters I wrote was one to Mr. Shaw. </p>
<p>By return mail I received a post card from him saying, "I have </p>
<p>received your letter and am doing some investigating. I will write </p>
<p>you tomorrow". Twentyfour hours later I received the promised </p>
<p>letter, which was so delicately phrased that it was almost </p>
<p>ambiguous. It seemed to say that there might be a minor temporary </p>
<p>job open at Harvard. Only upon careful reading did the last </p>
<p>paragraph make it clear that all I needed to do was to go to </p>
<p>Cambridge and (for some reason I never understood) report to Mr. </p>
<p>David W. Mann, who was a very talented instrument maker in the shops </p>
<p>of the Jefferson Physical Laboratory. Needless to say I was on the </p>
<p>next available train to Boston. Mr. Mann, without much conversation, </p>
<p>took me to Harry Mimno, who was then Associate Professor of Physics </p>
<p>and Communication Engineering. Professor Mimno hired me for a six-</p>
<p>month trial period at $20.00 per week, a tolerable and deeply </p>
<p>welcome wage.</p>
</font><p><hr>
<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Shaw">Henry S. Shaw</b> </a>37</p>
<p>Mr. Shaw deserves more praise and thanks than I could ever give him, </p>
<p>so I may as well testify to his admirable qualities at this point, </p>
<p>although it was a number of years before I found out how much he had </p>
<p>done for me. He was one of the finest type of Boston Brahmins </p>
<p>(although he lived in Exeter, New Hampshire when I knew him) who </p>
<p>had, I think, always been moderately wealthy and who, like many of </p>
<p>his kind, believed in doing good by stealth. Shortly before </p>
<p>receiving my letter he had given Harvard two or three thousand </p>
<p>dollars to support some research in UHF radio. Since this project </p>
<p>would require hiring a technician, who had not yet been chosen, </p>
<p>Harvard was in no position to decline when Mr. Shaw suggested that </p>
<p>they try me. At the end of my six months, Professor Mimno was </p>
<p>apparently satisfied but was, like most research directors before </p>
<p>World War II, without funds. Mr. Shaw stepped into the breach and, </p>
<p>without my hearing of it until much later, contributed my salary for </p>
<p>the next two or three years. I never knew Mr. Shaw intimately, </p>
<p>although I saw him at the laboratory from time to time. He never </p>
<p>showed, by word or attitude, that he had ever done anything for me, </p>
<p>but was always politely interested in my progress. I gradually </p>
<p>learned that I was by no means alone as a recipient of his </p>
<p>benefactions. It was ultimately possible to learn that he </p>
<p>occasionally had identified promising young men in the General Radio </p>
<p>factory and set them up in business for themselves. He was the </p>
<p>guiding spirit and at least partially a financial backer for the </p>
<p>early radio and weather research at the top of Mount Washington, </p>
<p>leading to the present observatory there. His contributions to </p>
<p>Harvard may not have been large, in today's terms, but were frequent </p>
<p>and always intelligently applied to advance knowledge in the fields </p>
<p>in which he was interested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>Mr. Shaw's character is admirably expressed, to those who knew him, </p>
<p>by the biography he supplied when elected a Fellow of the Institute </p>
<p>of Radio Engineers. These biographies used to be published, for the </p>
<p>hundred or two that held this honor, in the directory of members of </p>
<p>the Institute, and most Fellows seized the opportunity to puff </p>
<p>themselves up a little. Mr. Shaw's biography stood alone against </p>
<p>this background. In full, it said: </p>

</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found myself, in the fall of 1934, employed in an organization </p>
<p>known as "Cruft Laboratory" which took its name from a small </p>
<p>building officially known as "The Cruft High Tension Electrical </p>
<p>Laboratory". George Washington Pierce, later the Rumford professor </p>
<p>of physics, had assumed charge of this laboratory when it was built </p>
<p>in 1914 and continued as its director until World War II. Under his </p>
<p>leadership, one of the first hybrids between physics and engineering </p>
<p>was formed; an early exploration of the idea of a department of </p>
<p>applied physics. Harvard then had an Engineering School, and the </p>
<p>members of the faculty in Cruft had dual appointments as, say, </p>
<p>professor of physics and Communication Engineering, thus having </p>
<p>footholds in the Engineering School and in the College of Arts and </p>
<p>Sciences, which is always called simply "Harvard College", as </p>
<p>distinct from the various graduate schools. The instruction in Cruft </p>
<p>was entirely at the graduate level.</p>
<p>Professor Pierce, always known as "G.W.", had been interested in </p>
<p>radio from the 1890s onward and had, in 1910, published a well-known </p>
<p>book on the principles of wireless telegraphy. Under his </p>
<p>administration, it would have been more appropriate if the title of </p>
<p>the laboratory had used the words "high frequency" instead of "high </p>
<p>tension". The stalwarts of the organization, when I came, were </p>
<p>Professor E. Leon Chaffee, the great expert on high-power vacuum </p>
<p>tubes; professor Mimno, whose field was ionospheric radio wave </p>
<p>propagation; Dr. and later Professor Frederick V. Hunt, whose </p>
<p>catholic interests centered in acoustics; and Dr. Roger Hickman, who </p>
<p>later became Director of the physics Laboratories and Assistant Dean </p>
<p>of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>Cruft Laboratory was built, in part at least, to house a 100,000 </p>
<p>volt storage battery which was used to provide an unusually stable </p>
<p>source of power for x-ray diffraction studies and other researches. </p>
<p>This battery was kept operating until World War II, when it was </p>
<p>dismantled largely because Doctors Hunt and Hickman had perfected </p>
<p>the electronic voltage regulator and the expensive battery was no </p>
<p>longer essential.</p>
<p>In 1931 Harvard, through the efforts of professor Theodore Lyman, </p>
<p>the Director of the Jefferson physical Laboratory, had built the </p>
<p>Research Laboratory of Physics. When Dr. Lyman retired, this </p>
<p>building was most appropriately renamed in his honor. A large part </p>
<p>of the Cruft organization was actually housed in the R.L.P., </p>
<p>although it was operated entirely under the Cruft name.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Professor Mimno was a capable and quiet gentleman who had some of </p>
<p>the characteristics of Kipling's cat who walked by his wild lone. He </p>
<p>seldom discussed his plans before finding ways to bring them to </p>
<p>fruition. Although an excellent teacher and able administrator, his </p>
<p>greatest interest, I think, was in planning experiments and </p>
<p>designing equipment for them. Some of these projects were never </p>
<p>completed as, at times, Harry seemed to lose interest when the </p>
<p>constructional problems had been solved. It is possible that a </p>
<p>distaste for data taking and the actual writing of papers </p>
<p>contributed to his extreme selflessness in claiming scientific </p>
<p>credit. He was always a complete antithesis of the professor who </p>
<p>wins advancement and reputation by putting his name on research done </p>
<p>by his students. He was anxious to push his students and colleagues </p>
<p>ahead and kept himself as far in the background as possible. I was </p>
<p>often to find myself the beneficiary of this policy.</p>
<p>In my first year or two at Harvard, I contributed a little analysis </p>
<p>of Harry's earlier data and drew figures and collected references </p>
<p>for a review paper he was then writing. So far as I can remember, he </p>
<p>never thereafter actually wrote a scientific research paper, </p>
<p>although he was a valued coauthor of papers by me and by others. He </p>
<p>always spent a large fraction of his time in the work of technical </p>
<p>committees and in various editorial posts. His criticism and advice </p>
<p>about technical writing were always of great value, and I especially </p>
<p>treasure his rule for giving a ten minute scientific report: eight </p>
<p>minutes establishing the background, one minute about what you </p>
<p>yourself have done, and one minute showing the implications for the </p>
<p>future. Would that more scientists knew and followed this rule! </p>
<p>I remember that my first assignment was to paste large numbers of </p>
<p>Coast and Geodetic Survey maps onto great sheets of wallboard, so </p>
<p>that we had detailed maps showing the altitudes along radio </p>
<p>transmission paths throughout much of southern New England. From </p>
<p>these I, and others, scaled and drew profiles showing the </p>
<p>obstructions on interesting paths such as between Cambridge and </p>
<p>Hartford, Connecticut. These were supposed to help explain why some </p>
<p>very high frequency radio circuits were better than others.</p>
<p>Having discovered that I could draw a little, Professor Mimno had me </p>
<p>sketch the plans for an experimental vehicle that a couple of other </p>
<p>technicians, a pair of graduate students, and I built during my </p>
<p>first winter at Cambridge. This was a relatively rectangular copper </p>
<p>covered van built on the chassis of a 1927 Packard roadster that </p>
<p>Professor Mimno contributed to the cause. It contained three relay </p>
<p>racks for equipment, a large number of storage. batteries in the </p>
<p>regions formerly occupied by running boards, with provisions for </p>
<p>recharging them when electric power was available, and a number of </p>
<p>antennas for various of what were then called the ultrahigh </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Professor Mimno 40</p>
<p>frequencies. This van had only one operating defect: it was heavy, </p>
<p>weighing 8200 pounds. Because the Packard chassis, like all others </p>
<p>of its day, had only two wheel brakes, we drove it in fear that we </p>
<p>might come over the top of a hill and come face to face with a red </p>
<p>traffic light. My experience in driving this vehicle has stood me in </p>
<p>good stead for the rest of my life; I still pay great attention to </p>
<p>anything within a couple of hundred yards that might get in my way.</p>
<p>The two graduate students, Paul King and Harner Selvidge, and I </p>
<p>drove this thing to the spring meeting of the Physical Society in </p>
<p>Washington in 1935, just to show it off. It attracted a good bit of </p>
<p>interest and got rather bad pictures of us into the newspapers for </p>
<p>the first time. Professor Mimno hovered in the background with a </p>
<p>gentle smile on his face and let us show off to our hearts' content.</p>
<p>Somehow during this spring I also found time to build a sort of </p>
<p>primeval walkie-talkie. This was much like the radios built for the </p>
<p>Maine fire towers, but better constructed because of the fine shop </p>
<p>facilities available at Harvard. It contained a fairly powerful </p>
<p>transmitter and carried batteries enough to run it for several days. </p>
<p>As a result, the whole thing, which had about the size and something </p>
<p>of the shape of an Adirondack pack basket, weighed about 45 pounds. </p>
<p>It had straps so that it could be toted on the back, but fortunately </p>
<p>we could usually get it where we needed it by car. Both this device </p>
<p>and the "copper battle wagon" got their baptism in the summer of </p>
<p>1935.</p>
<p>"Doc" Selvidge, as part of the work toward his thesis, was trying to </p>
<p>show that the intensity of a radio signal is enhanced near the edge </p>
<p>of the shadow of an obstacle. This is an elementary principle of </p>
<p>optics and the result was clearly implicit in the equivalence of </p>
<p>radio and light waves that had been demonstrated by Heinrich Hertz </p>
<p>nearly fifty years before. There were, however, practical </p>
<p>difficulties in the measurement that made the problem a worthy one. </p>
<p>I had been assigned to help Doc with this work. We had tried </p>
<p>unsuccessfully to transmit a signal from the Arlington Heights water </p>
<p>tower and explore the shadow cast by the northern edge of the </p>
<p>Harvard Stadium against the upper seats on the southern side. As </p>
<p>might have been expected, there were too many reflections from </p>
<p>neighboring objects and, of course, the physical size of the </p>
<p>receiving antenna tended to blur the results. What was needed was a </p>
<p>much larger "knife-edge" and a bigger screen for the shadow to fall </p>
<p>upon.</p>
<p>We found a place for the experiment at Frenchman's Bay in Maine. </p>
<p>Here Mount Cadillac rises sharply about 1500 feet above the water </p>
<p>while, on the eastern side of the bay, the 400-foot crest of </p>
<p>Schoodic peninsula forms a fairly good knife edge. For a signal </p>
<p>transmitted from Mount Cadillac, the edge of the shadow of Schoodic </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Barharbor">Bar Harbor</b> </a>41</p>
<p>falls in the ocean about five miles east of the peninsula. We could </p>
<p>explore the diffraction pattern by receiving in a small boat from </p>
<p>close inshore behind Schoodic to a region fifty or sixty miles from </p>
<p>Mount Cadillac. The signals observed without the knife-edge could be </p>
<p>explored by taking a course along which there was no obstacle, some </p>
<p>twenty degrees south of the path across Schoodic.</p>
<p>In August, 1935, then, Doc and I found ourselves living in a cheap </p>
<p>room in Bar Harbor and "yachting" in the Gulf of Maine. It sounds </p>
<p>unbelievable now but, in those depression days, we were able to hire </p>
<p>an old lobster boat, complete with a young man to drive it, for </p>
<p>$25.00 a week. The technique was as follows. Each morning, when the </p>
<p>weather was fit, one of us would drive the copper truck up Mount </p>
<p>Cadillac and beyond the end of the road across a couple of hundred </p>
<p>yards of rock to the exact peak. In recent years I have walked over </p>
<p>this area and cannot imagine how we could have gotten the car there </p>
<p>without tipping it over. In 1935, however, we were young and didn't </p>
<p>know a serious obstacle when we saw it. The one of us not on the </p>
<p>mountain would have been dropped at the town pier and would go with </p>
<p>"Sonny" Tufts, our boatman, to explore either the shadowed or the </p>
<p>unshadowed course, and occasionally both in the course of a long </p>
<p>day's work. Communications between the boat and the truck were </p>
<p>through the walkie-talkie device, but were not often needed as the </p>
<p>schedule of transmission frequencies and polarizations was usually </p>
<p>established in advance. </p>
<p>Of course any number of things went wrong. Runs had to be repeated </p>
<p>again and again as equipment failed or peculiar effects were </p>
<p>observed. To our surprise, the whole experiment took two months, </p>
<p>running into October when the weather got fairly rough. While we </p>
<p>generally took turns on the mountain, luck saw to it that the most </p>
<p>interesting things happened when I was on the boat.</p>
<p>Our first vessel was the "OIC", always pronounced "oik" by us. She </p>
<p>was a venerable tub, 23 feet long and with a reliable motor, which </p>
<p>is to be expected among lobster boats along such a foggy coast. The </p>
<p>OIC served us well for three or four weeks until one pleasant </p>
<p>afternoon when, without warning, her sternpost and rudder fell off. </p>
<p>This left a considerable hole and she filled fairly rapidly. I </p>
<p>transmitted, using the walkietalkie, what I suppose was the first </p>
<p>SOS ever heard in the amateur five-meter band. To my surprise, I got </p>
<p>a response as my benefactor, Mr. Shaw, was in residence at Prospect </p>
<p>Harbor and heard my call for help. He rushed to the dock, </p>
<p>commandeered the first boat he came to, and chugged out just in time </p>
<p>to transfer all our equipment, except a set of batteries, before the </p>
<p>OIC sank. One of my pleasant memories is of stepping back, just as I </p>
<p>abandoned ship, to snatch the boat's bell as a souvenir. This bell, </p>
<p>suitably mounted and inscribed, was kept for years in the Cruft Lab </p>
<p>secretary's office. It finally came back to me, and now serves as a </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bar Harbor 42</p>
<p>dinner bell.</p>
<p>To my surprise, the owner made no fuss about losing the OIC. </p>
<p>Possibly he was grateful to have had a little income from her in her </p>
<p>last days. Her replacement was a longer boat, shaped somewhat like </p>
<p>an oversized batteau, whose name I do not remember. Her planking was </p>
<p>fairly good, but she suffered from a large number of rotten ribs, </p>
<p>which made her extremely limber. As the weather got worse and the </p>
<p>season later, we were more and more anxious to finish and get back </p>
<p>to Cambridge. We would usually start out in the boat every morning </p>
<p>and decide whether to continue or retreat when we got outside of the </p>
<p>protected waters of Frenchman's Bay.</p>
<p>One day I made the wrong decision and went on when I should have </p>
<p>given up. The outward trip was not too bad as we had a following </p>
<p>sea, but when we turned around we found it extremely rough. Our bow </p>
<p>would be flung high and would come down with a crash, opening seams </p>
<p>because of the bad ribs. After an hour or so we found that the boat </p>
<p>was becoming very heavy, which of course made her pound harder, as </p>
<p>the water was coming in slightly faster than we could pump it out. </p>
<p>It soon became obvious that we would not get to any of the towns on </p>
<p>the mainland. We were not far from Petit Manan light, but knew that </p>
<p>we could not land there because the tide was high and covered what </p>
<p>little beach there was. Everything else failing, we headed for Green </p>
<p>Island, a rocky outcrop near Petit Manan. To our surprise and </p>
<p>delight we found this to be rather like a tiny granite atoll, </p>
<p>obviously designed for distressed seafarers, with a "lagoon" fifty </p>
<p>yards or less in diameter and a narrow opening through which we </p>
<p>could enter. We drove the boat in, ran it aground on a gravelly </p>
<p>beach, and scrambled ashore over the bow and collapsed on the shore, </p>
<p>where we lay for some hours as both Sonny and I were, by this time, </p>
<p>extremely seasick.</p>
<p>We found the remains of a fisherman's hut which served for shelter, </p>
<p>as the weather was fortunately dry. In the morning the "lagoon" was </p>
<p>completely empty at low tide, so we set to work calking the open </p>
<p>seams in the hull. When the tide came in, we rolled the boat over so </p>
<p>that we could calk the second side after the water had gone down </p>
<p>again. Unfortunately the weight of the boat, coupled with the </p>
<p>badness of her ribs, made her spit out most of our first calking. We </p>
<p>had to wait for six tides, improving the calking at each </p>
<p>opportunity, before we judged the boat to be tight enough to get to </p>
<p>the mainland for more permanent repairs. </p>
<p>We were in intermittent communication with Doc Selvidge during this </p>
<p>interval. Each night and morning he would drive up the mountain far </p>
<p>enough to attain line-of-sight to our island and enquire how we were </p>
<p>getting on. He could, of course, have sent us help if we had needed </p>
<p>it. The only difficult part of this communication was to endure </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Marooned">Marooned / Harvard Football</b> </a>43</p>
<p>Doc's cheery remarks about how good his latest meal had been at our </p>
<p>favorite restaurant. These comments were hard to take, as our food </p>
<p>supply was limited to one or two sandwiches we had not cared to eat </p>
<p>on the first day. We did deliberately skip work on the boat for one </p>
<p>tide, when we discovered that we could, at low tide, wade chest-deep </p>
<p>over to Petit Manan. The lighthouse keeper there had a wife who was </p>
<p>an excellent cook and who provided us with a superb dinner. As an </p>
<p>extra bit of good luck for us, there were two very pretty daughters </p>
<p>who helped greatly to while away the hours until, at the next low </p>
<p>tide, we could wade back to our hut.</p>
<p>This minor adventure brought our expedition to a close. It can go </p>
<p>without saying that the radio waves behaved as they should and the </p>
<p>results helped Doc to get his degree.</p>

<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Football">Harvard Football</a></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had not been at Harvard long when I fell into the most absolute </p>
<p>sinecure I ever knew about. The Harvard Athletic Association </p>
<p>contracted with a commercial supplier for the main public address </p>
<p>system used during football games at the Harvard Stadium. The </p>
<p>Maintenance Department, however, had several loudspeakers installed </p>
<p>in the press box and owned a small amplifier and microphones that </p>
<p>were used to distribute items of information to reporters. A workman </p>
<p>brought this amplifier before each game and, thank goodness, carried </p>
<p>it up the many steps to the press box on top of the stadium. The </p>
<p>Department insisted that an electronics expert should always be on </p>
<p>hand in case something should happen to the amplifier during a game; </p>
<p>and further insisted that the expert should be backed up by a second </p>
<p>one, presumably in case the first one should have a heart attack </p>
<p>just as the amplifier failed. Ted Hunt easily secured the position </p>
<p>of greater responsibility and I fell heir to the second. For the </p>
<p>services each of us was paid eight dollars for each home game. We </p>
<p>occupied these sinecures for about five years in which nothing ever </p>
<p>went wrong.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to sit in our shirt sleeves behind glass in the </p>
<p>heated press box (and on the fifty-yard line, at that) and watch the </p>
<p>snow falling on the faithful who had paid good prices for their </p>
<p>seats. It also did our morale no harm to find that a beckoning </p>
<p>finger would produce a steward with hot dogs or coffee as required, </p>
<p>all by courtesy of the H.A.A. It was my good fortune to sit beside a </p>
<p>gentleman named, I think, Whiteside, who ran the scoreboard. I was </p>
<p>told that he had once been the crew coach, unlikely as this seems. </p>
<p>He was, however, a genius in his understanding of football, and I </p>
<p>learned enough from him to acquire an interest in the game that has </p>
<p>persisted ever since. Mr. Whiteside would sit watching the field as </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Football / "The Shadow" 44</p>
<p>the formations came into position for each play. At the snap of the </p>
<p>ball his fingers would play briefly over the many buttons on his </p>
<p>control box. By the time the whistle blew to end the play he had </p>
<p>called up the necessary data: the numbers of the men who had carried </p>
<p>the ball and made the tackle, the number of yards still needed, as </p>
<p>well as the position on the field. occasionally Mr. Whiteside would </p>
<p>carefully correct the yards gained by a unit or two after the play </p>
<p>was over, but in general he seemed to know exactly what would happen </p>
<p>before the play began. I was forever asking him why a play gained </p>
<p>thirteen yards when, as far as I could see, the same play had lost </p>
<p>ground a few minutes before. His explanations gave me an insight </p>
<p>into the complexities of the game that had hitherto completely </p>
<p>escaped me. I was sorry when the South African expedition and </p>
<p>subsequent events brought this era to a close. By that time I did </p>
<p>not need the money as badly as at first, but it was hard to give up </p>
<p>a "job" with such minimal and pleasant duties.</p>
<p>In the late fall of 1935, professor Mimno received a request from </p>
<p>the Federal Communications Commission, sent to many radio </p>
<p>experimenters, for help in identifying what had come to be called </p>
<p>"The Shadow". This was a curious form of interference that had </p>
<p>recently sprung up in the high frequency part of the radio spectrum. </p>
<p>Some guesses were wild enough to suppose the Ethiopians to be </p>
<p>jamming the Italian radios (in the only war that was going on at the </p>
<p>time) or vice versa. It happened that professor Mimno's suggestion </p>
<p>that Selvidge, King, and I should see what we could do about this </p>
<p>came just before he left for Europe. Harry had married a charming </p>
<p>girl in Germany in the previous summer, but Hitler had refused to </p>
<p>let her leave the the country without signing over her property to </p>
<p>the Nazi party, or something of that sort. Harry had had to come </p>
<p>back to Cambridge without her in September, and was devoting his </p>
<p>Christmas vacation to another, and successful, attempt to get her to </p>
<p>America.</p>
<p>Paul King and I attacked the new problem while Selvidge wandered off </p>
<p>into some other project. One of our first trials was to use an </p>
<p>oscilloscope in an attempt to decipher the peculiar wave form of the </p>
<p>Shadow signals, and we made the revealing discovery that a few of </p>
<p>the signals had a modulation that was synchronous with the Boston </p>
<p>power line frequency, while many did not. This, of course, proved </p>
<p>that there were a number of sources and the quite new diathermy </p>
<p>machines seemed to be possible culprits. By calling various </p>
<p>companies and acting like potential customers we identified one make </p>
<p>of machine that operated in the right frequency range and might have </p>
<p>the kind of modulation we had observed. It was especially convenient </p>
<p>that we found that the Harvard Athletic Department had recently </p>
<p>bought one. We took the copper truck over beside the Briggs Cage and </p>
<p>found that the suspected equipment put out a strong signal having </p>
<p>the observed characteristics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Shadow">"The Shadow"</b> </a>45</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next steps were easy. Supposing that the radio frequency energy </p>
<p>from the diathermy machine leaked back into the electric power </p>
<p>lines, we borrowed the machine from the Athletic Department and set </p>
<p>it up at Paul's home in Watertown, because his electric power came </p>
<p>in through overhead wires that might perform as a fairly good </p>
<p>antenna. We borrowed a radio call, NDA-1, from the U.S. Navy and </p>
<p>arranged for the Navy to alert its ships and shore stations to </p>
<p>listen for this call at an agreed frequency and time. We modified </p>
<p>the diathermy machine only by installing a tape reader in the plate </p>
<p>supply lead to make it speak in Morse code, and draped the cable </p>
<p>carrying the radiofrequency current around the floor in Paul's </p>
<p>living room until we brought the frequency to the agreed value. The </p>
<p>results were spectacular. The Navy reported strong signals from all </p>
<p>over the North Atlantic and the eastern half of the United States. </p>
<p>The Shadow had been tracked to its lair.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission promptly revealed the culprit </p>
<p>and we were attacked by numbers of reporters. At this point we could </p>
<p>not resist a practical joke. Having explained the experiment we </p>
<p>carefully emphasized that the work had been done under the direction </p>
<p>of Professor Mimno. The response was always, "Where is Professor </p>
<p>Mimno? We want to talk to him." To this we answered, "Oh, he is </p>
<p>arriving in New York tomorrow morning on the S.S. Bremen", and left </p>
<p>him to the mercies of the ship-news reporters.</p>
<p>Harry never admitted just how much he had been annoyed by this jest, </p>
<p>but I think he had his gentle revenge the next year when I was to </p>
<p>spend a week in London. He gave me a resounding letter of </p>
<p>introduction to Ralph Stranger of the British Broadcasting </p>
<p>Corporation. I presented this at my first opportunity only to find </p>
<p>that Mr. Stranger was not available that day. Other BBC engineers </p>
<p>were very kind in showing me around, however. I think I tried again </p>
<p>to find Mr. Stranger but not successfully although I was treated </p>
<p>with the most perfect politeness, by other people, and had an </p>
<p>excellent introduction into the ways and workings of the BBC. It was </p>
<p>not until several years later that I discovered that there was no </p>
<p>Ralph Stranger; that this was a pen name used by any of a group of </p>
<p>BBC engineers when they wished to write a popular article of less </p>
<p>than professional merit. </p>

<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Balloons">Weather Balloons</b> </a>46</p>
<p>In my first year or two at Harvard I enjoyed a personal and </p>
<p>technical acquaintance with Arthur Bent, a neighbor and friend of </p>
<p>Mr. Shaw in Exeter, New Hampshire. Arthur also was a dilettante </p>
<p>experimenter and was helping Dr. Brooks of the Blue Hill </p>
<p>Meteorological Observatory to make the first trials with balloon-</p>
<p>borne weather reporting devices. The Observatory had developed light </p>
<p>and cheap measuring instruments and Arthur was making tiny radio </p>
<p>transmitters powered by small flashlight batteries. These devices, </p>
<p>being heavy by today's standards, were lifted by eight or ten </p>
<p>weather balloons in tandem. I helped to fill and launch these on one </p>
<p>or two occasions, but the time I remember most happily was when I </p>
<p>was not at Blue Hill but listening to the signal at the laboratory. </p>
<p>I had no equipment for deciphering the telemetered pressure and </p>
<p>temperature readings, but I soon discovered that the frequency of </p>
<p>the transmitter was drifting slowly but steadily as the balloons </p>
<p>rose into the colder and colder regions of the atmosphere. I </p>
<p>recorded and plotted the frequency against time and was able to tell </p>
<p>when the instruments reached the base of the stratosphere where the </p>
<p>temperature becomes constant. Since I knew this height </p>
<p>approximately, I had determined the rate of rise of the balloons, </p>
<p>and was able to call Arthur an hour or two later and congratulate </p>
<p>him on reaching a height of seventy-five or eighty thousand feet. </p>
<p>Arthur never could understand how I determined this altitude as soon </p>
<p>as he did.</p>
<p>My only contribution to this program was minor but mildly </p>
<p>interesting. The signals from most of the flights failed quickly in </p>
<p>the stratosphere or below when the batteries froze. By experimenting </p>
<p>in a dry-ice box, I found that it helped to wrap the batteries with </p>
<p>a couple of feet of resistance wire and surround them with cotton </p>
<p>batting. By "wasting" about half of the available power in heating </p>
<p>the batteries themselves, the signals could be kept alive two or </p>
<p>three times longer. This technique was used for a time, until better </p>
<p>overall thermal insulation was achieved. </p>

<p>&nbsp;<a name="Eclipse"></p>
<b><p>The Eclipse Expedition to the Soviet Union</b> </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of 1935 Professor Mimno called Selvidge, King, and me </p>
<p>into his office to ask us, "Do you know where Ak-Bulak is?" When we </p>
<p>denied any knowledge, he said, "You had better find out. I think </p>
<p>you're going there". This was our introduction to the Harvardskaya </p>
<p>Ekspeditzia Solnechnovo Zatmenia (if my transliteration is accurate </p>
<p>enough), or the Harvard M.I.T. Solar Eclipse Expedition of 1936.</p>
<p>We soon found that Ak-Bulak is a small town in Kazakhstan, a section </p>
<p>of the Soviet Union that might be spoken of as southwestern Siberia. </p>
<p>It is on the rail line from Orenburg to Alma Ata, nearly south of </p>
<p>the Ural Mountains and barely over the line into Asia. It is in a </p>
<p>region picturesquely and accurately known as "the Hungry Steppe". We </p>
<p>found later that it is in a large alkaline plain where there is a </p>
<p>very sparse grass, but where any kind of crops or trees can be grown </p>
<p>only within a few yards of a stream and most of the streams are dry </p>
<p>in the summer.</p>
<p>A total solar eclipse is ordinarily observed where a rail line, or </p>
<p>some other mode of transportation for heavy equipment, crosses the </p>
<p>narrow path of totality. If there are several such intersections, </p>
<p>the place is chosen after a great deal of study of the probability </p>
<p>of clear skies in the various areas. It seems to be a general rule </p>
<p>that the selected site will be in a region where there are almost no </p>
<p>facilities for gracious living and all supplies must be imported. </p>
<p>The town in Russia had been chosen by the American astronomers and </p>
<p>physicists because it was to be the location for the expedition </p>
<p>conducted by Dr. Gerasimovic, who was the director of the famous </p>
<p>Poulkovo Observatory near Leningrad. Dr. Gerasimovic had worked at </p>
<p>Harvard for a year or two and was considered to be among the dozen </p>
<p>greatest astronomers in the world. He was also the head of the </p>
<p>organization charged with carrying out the Soviet Union's very </p>
<p>generous provisions for receiving and helping all foreign </p>
<p>expeditions.</p>
<p>Dr. Menzel, the leader of the Harvard M.I.T. expedition, had been </p>
<p>receptive to the idea of sending ionospheric sounding equipment to </p>
<p>observe the eclipse. The nominal reason was to see whether a </p>
<p>"corpuscular effect" could be detected. Because the sun emits heavy </p>
<p>charged particles that travel much more slowly than do light rays, </p>
<p>the corpuscular eclipse, if it existed, would occur at a somewhat </p>
<p>different place and a considerably different time than the visible </p>
<p>eclipse. It is, however, possible that a great attraction for the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>astronomers was the presumed fact that the radio observations could </p>
<p>go on despite cloudy weather. They could then provide some results </p>
<p>for the expedition even if optical measurements should be </p>
<p>impossible. </p>
<p>It was at least three months before it became certain that funds </p>
<p>enough to send all three of us could be promoted. This interval was </p>
<p>filled with activity. I spent much of the time designing and </p>
<p>building a pulse transmitter that could be swept through a quite </p>
<p>wide frequency range to the ionospheric layers. This involved my </p>
<p>first real invention at Harvard: a variometer of new design that </p>
<p>provided a large variation in frequency while permitting the </p>
<p>transmitter to operate with nearly constant power output.</p>
<p>The eclipse was to occur on June 19th, 1936. Because no one knew the </p>
<p>normal characteristics of the ionosphere over Kazakhstan, it would </p>
<p>be necessary for us to operate our equipment for a couple of months, </p>
<p>obtaining control data to define the normal variations with the time </p>
<p>of day. While Cruft Lab was busy with all the technical details, and </p>
<p>with the packing, the State Department was finding out how to get </p>
<p>permission to use the equipment. We were assured, finally, that a </p>
<p>good source of electric power would be found in Ak-Bulak, and </p>
<p>authorization to import our gear was obtained. Radio transmitting </p>
<p>licenses, or the Russian equivalent, were to be given us when we </p>
<p>passed through Moscow.</p>
<p>We three boys, with half a dozen tons of equipment, sailed from New </p>
<p>York on the SS Washington in early April, along with Dr. Menzel and </p>
<p>other members of the first contingent of astronomers. The Washington </p>
<p>was the sweetest smelling ship I ever sailed on, as she carried a </p>
<p>cargo of fifty million Washington Delicious apples consigned to </p>
<p>Cherbourg. I spent part of the ocean voyage in the third class </p>
<p>lounge of the Washington writing my first scientific paper at </p>
<p>Harvard, about the design of the variometer. We spent a few days in </p>
<p>London and Doc Selvidge and I found time to hire a car and explore </p>
<p>the environs as far as Cambridge, Oxford, and Stratford on Avon. In </p>
<p>London we were received by Professor (later Sir Edward) Appleton, by </p>
<p>far the most famous man in ionospheric research, who was, a few </p>
<p>years later, to be awarded a Nobel Prize for his work.</p>
<p>It was also at this time that I made the acquaintance of the BBC, as </p>
<p>mentioned above. My happiest recollection there is of happening to </p>
<p>be in the main control room when teatime arrived. This room had an </p>
<p>immense console, with positions for fully a score of operators (when </p>
<p>so many might be needed) each of whom had a board full of mixing </p>
<p>switches and gain controls for sending any or all of several </p>
<p>programs to any or all of a number of radio networks. As I recall </p>
<p>it, about half of the positions were occupied when the clocks </p>
<p>indicated teatime. The double doors at the end of the room opened </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="prep">Eclipse Preparations.</b> </a>49</p>
<p>and stewards wheeled two large tea wagons into the room. Each </p>
<p>operator flipped up his control switches ("down" still means "on" in </p>
<p>England) and turned around on his stool to receive his tea and </p>
<p>scones. As far as I could tell, all radio broadcasting in Britain </p>
<p>stopped for twenty minutes or so. In those days, before advertising </p>
<p>appeared in the British air, it was assumed that everyone in the </p>
<p>country would be having his tea at the time and no one would be </p>
<p>interested in radio just then.</p>
<p>In our travels, Doc and I had happened to be in Stratford about </p>
<p>April 20th. I still remember, on every 23rd of that month, the </p>
<p>bulletin board we saw in front of the Shakespeare Theatre, which </p>
<p>said: </p>
<p>April 23rd </p>
<p>"Much Ado about Nothing"</p>
<p>Shakespeare's Birthday </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We proceeded by train to Hull and took a Finnish ship to Helsinki, </p>
<p>with a stop of about twenty-four hours in Copenhagen. On this trip </p>
<p>Doc and I had the luck to become acquainted with two Finnish girls, </p>
<p>Lisa and Greta. They taught me, among other things, how to </p>
<p>disassemble an anchovy gracefully, and they were a great help in </p>
<p>giving us a quick introduction to the charms of Denmark. Copenhagen </p>
<p>was, as it still remains, the finest city in Europe in which to </p>
<p>amuse oneself. It then provided amazingly inexpensive entertainment, </p>
<p>although most other prices seemed comparable to those in the United </p>
<p>States. An afternoon movie, dinner at a good restaurant, a few hours </p>
<p>at Tivoli including a concert by Kirsten Flagstad, and supper at a </p>
<p>night club, with intervening taxis, cost us a total of about five </p>
<p>dollars a couple.</p>
<p>It was in Denmark that I first developed a distaste for trying </p>
<p>foreign languages. I had never before found myself faced with a </p>
<p>strange tongue. On our first walk in Copenhagen, I found that I </p>
<p>needed cigarets. I identified a tobacco store by the displays in the </p>
<p>window and went in, with the others in the group betting loudly that </p>
<p>I would not be able to get what I wanted. Not having any idea what </p>
<p>Danish sounded like, I went up to the counter and said firmly, "I </p>
<p>would like some cigarets, if you please". "Yes, sir!", said the </p>
<p>clerk, "Turkish or Virginia?" I am ashamed to say that since then </p>
<p>most of my conversations with foreigners have been conducted in much </p>
<p>the same way.</p>
<p>It happened that the Bell Telephone Company had only recently opened </p>
<p>the "first" ship-to-shore telephone service at a minimum charge of </p>
<p>$9.00. I was consequently greatly surprised, at breakfast on the </p>
<p>morning after leaving Copenhagen, to hear Lisa remark that she </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Russia">The Trip to Russia </a>50</p>
<p>thought she would telephone her grandmother in Helsinki, and I was </p>
<p>especially startled when she said that the call would cost two </p>
<p>shillings. I presently followed her to the radio room where she </p>
<p>spoke to the operator, who used his morse key for a minute or two </p>
<p>and then motioned her to a small telephone booth in a corner. She </p>
<p>talked to her grandmother successfully and, when she came out, paid </p>
<p>the operator 20 Finnish marks, or 44 cents. I enquired into this </p>
<p>phenomenon carefully. It appeared that the practical Finns had </p>
<p>observed that very minor modifications would convert their </p>
<p>telegraphic equipment for voice operation. Since this service could </p>
<p>be provided cheaply, they charged little for it. No guarantee of </p>
<p>successful operation was offered, in case the ship were too far from </p>
<p>home or if transmission conditions were bad. This episode caused me </p>
<p>to question the American habit of waiting until highly professional </p>
<p>and reliable service could be provided and then charging a high </p>
<p>price for it. It still seems to me that there may often be good </p>
<p>reason to offer an inexpensive but useful service, even if it cannot </p>
<p>always be completely satisfactory. It may be of interest to compare </p>
<p>this story with the record, described above, of the tolerance of bad </p>
<p>service by the same telephone company, when we had tried to improve </p>
<p>it in western Maine. This experience on the Finnish ship, however, </p>
<p>remains the first of a number of instances in which I came to wonder </p>
<p>whether the American way was necessarily the best.</p>
<p>There had been the customary "last night out" party on the </p>
<p>Washington, but it was not nearly so memorable as the last night on </p>
<p>the A "Last Night Out" Finnish ship. The fun really started at </p>
<p>lunch, when Greta began questioning us about a gentleman we had met </p>
<p>in London. He was a Jesuit priest and wellknown astronomer, who was </p>
<p>leading an expedition to some other part of the Soviet Union, and </p>
<p>happened to be travelling on the same ship with us. We had been </p>
<p>carefully instructed to call him "Doctor" rather than "Father" in </p>
<p>the Soviet Union, and he had left his clerical garb in London and </p>
<p>was now wearing a business suit. Greta exhibited some shook at </p>
<p>learning that he was a priest, so we of course pressed her for the </p>
<p>reason for her interest. She explained that he had been offering her </p>
<p>a supply of American cigarets if she would come to his cabin to get </p>
<p>them; and she had some doubts about his intentions. Doc and I found </p>
<p>the opportunity too good to miss. We assured Greta that if, after </p>
<p>supper when the priest would be sitting with his expedition members </p>
<p>in the smoking room, she passed by on the outside and gave him what </p>
<p>was then known as a "come hither" look, he would be sure to join </p>
<p>her. She was then to agree to accept his cigarets and, after passing </p>
<p>by to give us a signal we invented, get into his cabin and close the </p>
<p>door. She would then scream and the rest of us would burst in and </p>
<p>"save" her.</p>
<p>This plot started very well. After we had all been in various parts </p>
<p>of the smoking room for a while, Greta slipped outside and presently </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Night">A "Last Night Out" </a>51</p>
<p>drifted past the windows, giving the priest a look that Doc or I </p>
<p>might have enjoyed receiving. The good father promptly excused </p>
<p>himself and disappeared. Then there was a long interval with no </p>
<p>signal from Greta. When we could stand the suspense no longer, Doc </p>
<p>and I took a turn around the decks to see what we could discover. We </p>
<p>saw Greta in a little cubbyhole called the music room, at a table by </p>
<p>the window. She was alone, but there were two drinks on the table </p>
<p>and she motioned us to keep away. Doc carelessly made some jubilant </p>
<p>remark about the two glasses just as the priest came around the </p>
<p>corner of the deck house, apparently headed for the door of the </p>
<p>music room. Doc, I think, made things worse by trying to pretend </p>
<p>that he had speaking of his eyeglasses. In any event, the highly </p>
<p>intelligent priest promptly returned to the smoking room and </p>
<p>barricaded himself behind the other members of his expedition.</p>
<p>Doc and I went back to Lisa and we waited a long time, but Greta did </p>
<p>not return. After a while we set out to find her, which we finally </p>
<p>did. She was in a dark corner at the aft end of the boat deck being </p>
<p>thoroughly kissed by a man we had never seen before. Her new friend </p>
<p>presently brought her back to the smoking room and spent the rest of </p>
<p>the evening pouring drinks into her. At the end of the evening, when </p>
<p>Greta had obviously taken as much as she could hold, Lisa rescued </p>
<p>her and took her to the girls' cabin. The entertainment did not end </p>
<p>even then, as Greta's new man and another, who also had had too much </p>
<p>to drink, spent much of the night trying to gain access to the </p>
<p>girls' room. When their intermittent visits to pound on the door had </p>
<p>created disturbance enough, this problem was solved. Dr. Menzel and </p>
<p>Wallace Brode, the two largest men in our party, changed cabins with </p>
<p>the girls. When the two drunks made their next visit, the </p>
<p>astronomers opened the door and scared the visitors into relative </p>
<p>sobriety.</p>
<p>We landed at Helsinki in the early morning. While I was waiting in </p>
<p>line at the customs shed, I was suddenly conscious of an alcoholic </p>
<p>aura creeping up about me. Turning, I discovered Greta weaving her </p>
<p>way across the floor, coming to claim a goodby kiss.</p>
<p>When I had administered this restorative, I realized that she was </p>
<p>followed by at least a dozen members of her family who had come to </p>
<p>meet her. They were individually introduced in correct not to say </p>
<p>prim Finnish form, and I still occasionally wonder what they must </p>
<p>have been thinking.</p>
</font><p><hr>
<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Helsinki">A Day in Helsinki</b> </a>52</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A day in Helsinki was a delight, the absolute cleanliness of the </p>
<p>city being a revelation. I had the feeling that I would not hesi </p>
<p>tate to sit on any curb in white flannels. Helsinki is known for its </p>
<p>excellent modern buildings. I was particularly impressed by the </p>
<p>Parliament building of pink Finnish granite, apparently growing out </p>
<p>of the top of a modest hill which was covered with green lawns </p>
<p>interrupted by outcroppings of the same beautiful stone. The city </p>
<p>seemed to have more and better statues than any other I have seen.</p>
<p>One disadvantage was the absolute strangeness of the Finnish </p>
<p>language. No advertising signs or inscriptions were in the least </p>
<p>intelligible to one with only traces of Latin, French, and German. </p>
<p>After a few hours of wandering around Helsinki, enjoying everything </p>
<p>but understanding nothing written, I came upon a large statue of </p>
<p>three nude blacksmiths working at an anvil, uncomfortable as that </p>
<p>may sound. The pedestal of the statue had a long inscription which I </p>
<p>had nearly deciphered to the end before I realized that it was in </p>
<p>Latin.</p>
<p>This lack of communication did not include the spoken word. Lisa and </p>
<p>Greta had explained to us that a Finnish child first learned (after </p>
<p>Finnish) Swedish, then German, and then English; and normally had </p>
<p>had nine years of English before graduating from high school. The </p>
<p>great department store Stockmann's, for example, had the largest </p>
<p>English bookstore in Europe and would hire no clerk who did not </p>
<p>speak English. Because of his shyness, it was often hard to get a </p>
<p>Finn to use English, but after this barrier had been broken we </p>
<p>usually found that he spoke the language more accurately than we </p>
<p>did.</p>
<p>The time in Helsinki passed all too quickly, aided by the first and </p>
<p>finest Finnish bath I ever had, and we found ourselves on the night </p>
<p>train to Leningrad. The examination at the border, which was then </p>
<p>much closer to Leningrad than it is today, was the most complete and </p>
<p>time consuming I have ever experienced. It seemed to require the </p>
<p>services of a dozen officers of gradually increasing rank, but </p>
<p>because the ceremonies were conducted entirely in Russian, we did </p>
<p>not understand either the problems or solutions. </p>
<p>Another hour or two on the train brought us to Leningrad, where we </p>
<p>were transferred to the Astoria Hotel. The Astoria was the Intourist </p>
<p>first class hotel and still had some of its prerevolutionary </p>
<p>elegance. The stone exterior was liberally pockmarked with wartime </p>
<p>bullet holes, and most of the draperies had apparently not been </p>
<p>changed (and some perhaps not dusted) since the revolution. It was, </p>
<p>however, except for a characteristic Russian lethargy in the </p>
<p>service, a fine hotel; and the dining room was actually the best I </p>
<p>have eaten in regularly. I must explain that one of the generous </p>
<p>concessions for foreign expeditions was to give us Intourist first </p>
<p>class tickets, which covered hotels, meals, and transportation, for </p>
<p>the third class price, which was then $5.00 per day. In a hotel </p>
<p>restaurant, our firstclass tickets gave us carte blanche, with no </p>
<p>limit on what and how much we ate. We enjoyed a game of trying to </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Lennigrad">Leningrad in 1936</b> </a>53</p>
<p>eat, at the prices listed on the menu, $20.00 worth of food at a </p>
<p>meal. I still recall, with nostalgia, the "chicken cutlets", the </p>
<p>Souffle' Alaska, and the quantities of fresh Beluga caviar we ate.</p>
<p>Leningrad (formerly St. Petersburg) is a beautiful and fascinating </p>
<p>city. It was founded in 1703 when Peter the Great decided to move </p>
<p>his capital to have access to the Baltic sea for the fleet he wished </p>
<p>to have. As the Grand Dukes and lesser members of the court moved </p>
<p>there, they built palaces as near that of the Tsar as their status </p>
<p>permitted. Leningrad is therefore more or less a city of palaces, </p>
<p>three or four miles in diameter, with a surrounding ring of wooden </p>
<p>cabins to house the necessary shopkeepers and other supporting </p>
<p>tradesmen. My favorite was St. Isaac's Cathedral, dating from 1820 </p>
<p>and now an "antireligious" museum. At the time I saw it, the </p>
<p>cathedral contained the first of the frozen mammoths from Siberia. </p>
<p>St. Isaac's is built of the beautiful Finnish granite, with </p>
<p>monolithic columns sixty feet high and seven feet in diameter. It </p>
<p>has a dome in which the Soviets have hung a Foucault pendulum that </p>
<p>they claim is one hundred meters long. I timed it carefully and </p>
<p>could only give it credit for ninety-two meters but, even so, it </p>
<p>must be one of the longest anywhere. The building looks new. The </p>
<p>stone is meticulously polished and I could not find a crack in the </p>
<p>mortar. The eastern wall of the interior is especially impressive. </p>
<p>Except for a few mosaics of saints, it is completely panelled with </p>
<p>irregular polished sheets of malachite.</p>
<p>We visited many of the tourist attractions, being especially </p>
<p>fascinated by the contents of the Winter Palace and the Hermitage </p>
<p>Museum, which were then separate. The Soviets have a way of </p>
<p>collecting all the great art of a type in a single place. The </p>
<p>Hermitage was always one of the great art museums of the world, and </p>
<p>the addition to it of other collections has made it stupendous. We </p>
<p>also enjoyed a visit to the Summer Palace at Tsarskoe Selo. </p>
<p>Catherine's Palace there is especially magnificent. It was built </p>
<p>under the specification, "Make it like Versailles, but bigger". The </p>
<p>rooms occupied by the last Tsar and Tsarina are especially touching. </p>
<p>The Tsar's is highly functional, dominated by a large desk and an </p>
<p>immense bed, while the Tsarina's is cluttered in Victorian fashion, </p>
<p>with every inch of wall space covered by an icon. One can understand </p>
<p>how Rasputin could attain such dominance over her mind.</p>
<p>I am sorry that the room that pleased me most in Catherine's Palace </p>
<p>can no longer be the same. It was relatively small, possibly thirty </p>
<p>by forty feet, with walls fifteen or more feet high, and was </p>
<p>completely lined with a mosaic of amber. In this room the Soviets </p>
<p>exhibited all of the finest amber artifacts in the country, such as </p>
<p>punch bowls nearly two feet in diameter, each carved from a single </p>
<p>block of amber by one of the finest artists. Some of the carved </p>
<p>pieces were a curious form of pornography: beautiful sea shells </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leningrad in 1936 54</p>
<p>with, in the bottom of each one, two or three small nude figures in </p>
<p>the most indecent positions imaginable. Apparently there had been an </p>
<p>era in which the courtiers vied to see who could have executed the </p>
<p>finest example of this peculiar form of art. I am sorry to have </p>
<p>heard that the Germans, during the siege of Leningrad, destroyed or </p>
<p>carried away the entire contents of this room. </p>
<p>At Poulkovo Observatory we had our first experience with a Russian </p>
<p>party, given for two or three expeditions that were passing through </p>
<p>Leningrad at the time. The food and drink were supplied in copious </p>
<p>quantities, but the thing that most impressed us was the way a group </p>
<p>of people would suddenly be inspired to move to one end of the room </p>
<p>and form a chorus, singing beautifully. Or perhaps they would clear </p>
<p>the tables away from the center of the room to show us their amateur </p>
<p>versions of Cossack dances. Here we first saw evidence of a fact </p>
<p>that frequently impressed us; that the Russians could completely </p>
<p>forget their problems and show greater signs of enjoyment than most </p>
<p>Americans can.</p>
<p>We were in Leningrad at the right time to see the May Day parade. </p>
<p>Everyone assured us that this was not equal to the Moscow </p>
<p>celebration, but it was sufficiently impressive. We were given seats </p>
<p>in the reviewing stand in front of the Winter Palace, which may have </p>
<p>held two or three hundred of the specially favored officials, while </p>
<p>the parade poured in through the several streets opening into </p>
<p>Admiralty Square and joined to pass between us and the great </p>
<p>Nicholas column in the center of the square. Leningrad had a </p>
<p>population of about three million, and people claimed that there </p>
<p>were at least two million in the parade. They passed by at a fairly </p>
<p>rapid rate, usually forty or fifty abreast, for fully ten hours. </p>
<p>There must have been at least a hundred thousand "red" flags, </p>
<p>ranging from scarlet, maroon, and crimson, through cerise and orange </p>
<p>to pink. So far as I know, no one watched the parade except the few </p>
<p>in the reviewing stand. My favorite groups were a band that marched </p>
<p>by playing the "Maine Stein Song", and a factory soviet that carried </p>
<p>a tennis court with an excellent game of mixed doubles being played </p>
<p>on it.</p>
<p>The next day we took the train to Moscow, where we were to spend </p>
<p>about a week. I remember very little about that city, at this time, </p>
<p>because we spent most of our days at the American Embassy, or </p>
<p>visiting various officials with an Embassy representative, trying to </p>
<p>straighten out our authorizations.</p>
<p>On May third or fourth, we were taken to see Lenin's Tomb. Because </p>
<p>of the holiday season, the line waiting for admission wound back and </p>
<p>fourth the length of Red Square half a dozen times. It obviously </p>
<p>would have required waiting all day, except that our Intourist guide </p>
<p>spoke to one of the Red Army guards at the entrance to the tomb. The </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Mayday">May Day in Leningrad</b> </a>55</p>
<p>guards then took their rifles off their shoulders and used them </p>
<p>horizontally to push back the crowd at the entrance so that we could </p>
<p>be bowed in. Lenin's body is displayed with impressive effect. One </p>
<p>goes down far underground, following the crowd step by step in </p>
<p>gradually fading light. On entering the burial chamber in almost </p>
<p>total darkness, one comes up two or three steps and passes by the </p>
<p>side of the glass sarcophagus, which is dimly lighted from the four </p>
<p>upper corners. Lenin lies there in a simple army jacket with his </p>
<p>hands folded on the outside of a crimson velvet coverlet that is </p>
<p>drawn up over his body. No one can see this without emotion.</p>
<p>All of our and the Embassy's efforts to obtain our radio licenses </p>
<p>failed. Every request we made, either through the Academy of </p>
<p>Sciences or through some other channel, disappeared into the "region </p>
<p>of darkness", the "gaypayoo", later OGPU, and never heard of again. </p>
<p>The ultimate opinion, informally agreed to by the Embassy, was that </p>
<p>no one dared say "yes" to the radical proposal to allow foreigners </p>
<p>to make Moscow to Ak-Bulak radio transmissions in the Soviet Union. </p>
<p>The result of this opinion was that we said to ourselves, "Here we </p>
<p>are, distinguished foreign scientists (by definition), invited by </p>
<p>the government and granted all sorts of assistance. Certainly no one </p>
<p>will dare object, no matter what we do". As time was running out, we </p>
<p>decided that we had to go ahead with our plans and see what </p>
<p>happened.</p>
<p>I remember little about the two and a half day train ride from </p>
<p>Moscow except the heat and the necessity of closing windows in our </p>
<p>compartments or otherwise protecting our belongings whenever the </p>
<p>train stopped. Without such precaution hands or long sticks with </p>
<p>hooks at the end would reach in the windows and grope around to see </p>
<p>what could be caught.</p>
<p>We arrived at Ak-Bulak quite early in the morning. My first shocks </p>
<p>were to find that most of the people resembled Mongolians while most </p>
<p>of the beasts of burden were camels. Somehow these ideas were </p>
<p>entirely new to me. Ak-Bulak was supposed to be a town of 9,000 </p>
<p>people, but our private estimates were more like 2,000. There were a </p>
<p>few horses and oxen among the camels, but the only automobiles were </p>
<p>two Russian imitations of the Ford Model A that had been brought in </p>
<p>to support the two expeditions. I never thought to enquire where the </p>
<p>gasoline for these cars came from.</p>
<p>Provisions for our accomodation were simple. A temporary railroad </p>
<p>siding had been built at an angle to the main line. Onto this had </p>
<p>been pushed an old pre-revolutionary private car with a dining room, </p>
<p>a kitchen, and three or four bedrooms. There was also a regular </p>
<p>WagonLit, to supply extra bedrooms, and a baggage car. Later, as </p>
<p>more astronomers arrived, one or two more Wagons-Lit were added, and </p>
<p>finally even a bath car. Perhaps railroad switches were in short </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="MtoA">Moscow to Ak-Bulak</b> </a>56</p>
<p>supply that year. Whatever the reason, our siding was not connected </p>
<p>to the main line except on the occasions when our cars were to be </p>
<p>rearranged or additions made to our "train". At these times, spikes </p>
<p>were removed from a section of the main line so that the rails could </p>
<p>be bent around to connect to our spur. Each time this happened, the </p>
<p>rails seemed to kink in a different place so that, by the time we </p>
<p>left, the main line looked rather like the trail of a drunken snake. </p>
<p>Our train had an adequate supply of cooks, waiters, and stewards who </p>
<p>were attached to us for the duration. They were headed, thank </p>
<p>goodness, by Jerry Gourievitch who, when at home, was the manager of </p>
<p>one of the Moscow hotels, and who spoke good English with a Brooklyn </p>
<p>accent, as he had lived in that city for some years. The second and </p>
<p>major shock came within an hour or two of our arrival, when we </p>
<p>discovered that the 220-volt 50-cycle electric power we had been </p>
<p>promised did not exist. Installation of this had apparently been </p>
<p>part of an earlier five-year plan, and Moscow did not know that it </p>
<p>had never been done. Doc Selvidge got a magnificent photograph of </p>
<p>several of the expedition people with horrified expressions as they </p>
<p>received this bit of news. For many years a copy of this picture </p>
<p>hung on one of the bulletin boards at the lab, entitled "What! No </p>
<p>AC?" The only electricity in town came from a small DC generator </p>
<p>that was operated from sunset to one A.M., to supply a few lights at </p>
<p>the railroad station. We spent a few days in turmoil, the question </p>
<p>being whether we could improvise something or whether we radio </p>
<p>people would have to move to Tomsk or Omsk, where we would be out of </p>
<p>touch with the rest of the expedition and where no provisions had </p>
<p>been made for us. </p>
<p>We finally worked our way out of this difficulty. Someone found, in </p>
<p>Orenburg, an old six-kilowatt rotary converter that was intended to </p>
<p>change 150 volts DC to 220 volts AC. There was in Ak-Bulak one </p>
<p>accessible piece of power equipment; an old German diesel engine </p>
<p>that ran a small grain mill. This engine had one cylinder with about </p>
<p>22 inch bore and 24inch stroke, and a flywheel fourteen feet in </p>
<p>diameter. It operated at about 50 R.P.M. and was supposed to deliver </p>
<p>50 horsepower. The grain mill was called the Prosobdir and was a </p>
<p>mile or more from our railroad siding.</p>
<p>We induced the Russians, through our steward Jerry and the local </p>
<p>Communist Party leader, Sheegin, to drive the converter (as a </p>
<p>generator) from the diesel. They belted a three-foot wheel attached </p>
<p>to the flywheel up to a six-inch pulley on a countershaft and from a </p>
<p>thirty-inch wheel on the countershaft to a five-inch wheel on the </p>
<p>generator. This brought the speed up to 1800 R.P.M. and gave us an </p>
<p>average of 60-cycle frequency.</p>
<p>The Russian method for splicing belts bothered us a great deal. </p>
<p>There were various scraps of belting around the Prosobdir, but no </p>
<p>very long ones. These scraps were five or six inches wide and a </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="AC">"What! No AC?"</b> </a>57</p>
<p>large fraction of an inch thick. The Russian technique was to </p>
<p>overlap the ends of the belts a dozen inches and put six or eight </p>
<p>stove bolts through the overlapping parts. What happened when one of </p>
<p>these joints went around a five- or six-inch pulley was a shame. I </p>
<p>shall always remember that there were five splices in one of our </p>
<p>belts and two in the other. These beat out a kind of syncopated </p>
<p>Conga rhythm as they passed around our pulleys. Instead of a steady </p>
<p>60-cycle frequency we had something that jumped erratically from 50 </p>
<p>to 70 cycles.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our primitive radio sounding equipment depended on </p>
<p>the powerline frequency for its calibration of the heights of the </p>
<p>ionospheric layers. The situation was intolerable. We spent hours </p>
<p>pleading for new belts (we had not yet learned to scream and yell </p>
<p>and bang on the desk) but it appeared that belts were in short </p>
<p>supply that year and new ones were not even available in Moscow. </p>
<p>This stalemate lasted, while we were getting our equipment running </p>
<p>after a fashion, until Dr. Gerasimovic arrived at Ak-Bulak. Taking </p>
<p>advantage of his position as chairman of all the Russian eclipse </p>
<p>work, I met him on the station platform in the early morning with a </p>
<p>full account of our grievances. A few hours later, when time </p>
<p>permitted, he came to take a thoughtful look at the wild behavior of </p>
<p>our frequency meter and we all adjourned to the Prosobdir, with Dr. </p>
<p>Gerasimovic accompanied by a crowd of twenty-five or thirty yesmen </p>
<p>and flunkies. After watching our seven splices for a few minutes he </p>
<p>spoke about fifty words in Russian. At this signal, half a dozen </p>
<p>people broke out of the crowd around him and took off at a run. </p>
<p>Within thirty minutes we had new belts. They obviously must have </p>
<p>come from a small grain elevator that was very much out of bounds, </p>
<p>and about which I shall say more later. We found some leather to cut </p>
<p>up and laced these belts ourselves in American fashion. The results </p>
<p>were excellent as the frequency remained quite stable, except that </p>
<p>it dropped every time a sack of grain was thrown into the mill. This </p>
<p>did not bother us too much, as we arranged to have the exclusive use </p>
<p>of the diesel at critical times, especially during the eclipse. </p>
<p>The village of Ak-Bulak had a few wooden buildings, including the </p>
<p>Prosobdir and the railroad station. Some houses were of wood in the </p>
<p>conventional Russian country style with lots of gingerbread </p>
<p>decorations. They were not painted. The great majority were built of </p>
<p>sundried bricks. These started with a pit, usually about three feet </p>
<p>deep, so that the side walls were often no more than three or four </p>
<p>feet high. These were whitewashed, at least when new. The lifetime </p>
<p>of such a building, exposed to the Siberian winter, was apparently </p>
<p>only five or six years. Some houses consisted of three or four such </p>
<p>rooms, and a new room might be added each year or two while the </p>
<p>oldest rooms, at the other end of the house, gradually collapsed. As </p>
<p>a result, the houses tended to creep around the building lots, </p>
<p>rather like the pattern in a game of dominoes. The family and </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="AkBulak">Life in Ak-Bulak</b> </a>58</p>
<p>whatever livestock it had all lived together, and the density of </p>
<p>smells and flies and other insects was so forbidding that we </p>
<p>practically never entered one of these houses, even in the rare </p>
<p>cases when we were invited.</p>
<p>We had the doubtful privilege of watching bricks made. The technique </p>
<p>was to dig a pit twenty or thirty feet in diameter and three or four </p>
<p>feet deep, or until a stratum of clay was exposed. Some water was </p>
<p>added and two or three horses were driven into the pit. Then fifteen </p>
<p>or twenty men would surround the pit and lash the horses for an hour </p>
<p>or two, until the clay was reduced to a suitable consistency. The </p>
<p>bricks were then formed and set out to dry, exactly as in other </p>
<p>parts of the world.</p>
<p>For reasons probably lost since the days of the caravans, the main </p>
<p>street in Ak-Bulak was fully a hundred yards wide. It was, of </p>
<p>course, all sand and was dense enough to drive on easily. Somewhere </p>
<p>near the middle was a single cart track marking the preferred path </p>
<p>to follow. This was a little firmer and smoother than the rest. One </p>
<p>day I had the pleasure of watching the drivers of the only two cars </p>
<p>within a hundred miles play "chicken" on this path. They happened to </p>
<p>be coming from the opposite ends and neither would consider turning </p>
<p>out for the other. They both began blowing their horns violently </p>
<p>when scores of yards apart and sounded them continuously until they </p>
<p>were forced to stop with the radiators within a yard of each other. </p>
<p>Then the drivers got out and shouted at each other for ten minutes, </p>
<p>to try to determine which should get off the beaten path.</p>
<p>The grain elevator stood beside this main street between our siding </p>
<p>and the Prosobdir. We often passed it several times a day, usually </p>
<p>either on foot or on bicycles. I have never seen an institution that </p>
<p>this part of Kazakhstan had been denied supplies during the famine </p>
<p>so obviously well guarded as this elevator. The reason was </p>
<p>presumably of 1932 and 1933, and many people had starved. The </p>
<p>members of our expedition were, I believe, the first foreigners to </p>
<p>be allowed to visit the area after that episode. The grain elevator </p>
<p>stood inside a solid wooden fence ten feet high with a single gate. </p>
<p>Inside the fence was a large pack of dogs -- or possibly wolves -- </p>
<p>as well as we could tell from their appearance and their howling. At </p>
<p>each side of the gate was a bench on which sat a half a dozen </p>
<p>Mongolian guards. For the whole two months we were there, these </p>
<p>guards never showed any sign of relaxation. As we came within fifty </p>
<p>yards they would get up and cock their rifles. They would then keep </p>
<p>us carefully covered until we reached a safe distance beyond the </p>
<p>gate. Because these guards had the most unreliable look of anyone I </p>
<p>never saw on the "wrong" end of a gun, the tension we felt when we </p>
<p>passed them was extremely real.</p>
<p>The climate in Ak-Bulak was supposed to range from fifty or sixty </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life in Ak-Bulak 59</p>
<p>degrees Fahrenheit below zero in the winter to one hundred and </p>
<p>thirty degrees more or less in the summer. I could easily believe </p>
<p>this as the daily range in temperature was phenomenal, presumably as </p>
<p>a result of the alkaline soil and sparse vegetation. Near the middle </p>
<p>of May a thin layer of ice would form on a pail of water left out </p>
<p>overnight, and the temperature would reach a hundred in the </p>
<p>afternoon. When we got up in the morning we would put on all the </p>
<p>clothes we had, and then gradually remove them (or most of them) </p>
<p>before lunch time. In the late afternoon we would begin reversing </p>
<p>the operation. I had with me a maximum-minimum thermometer. Someone </p>
<p>stole it about the first of June, but before then it had reached a </p>
<p>hundred and twelve degrees in the shade. To add to our discomfort, </p>
<p>there would be a sandstorm every afternoon about four o'0lock. This </p>
<p>was driven by the strong wind that seems to prevail in such a hot, </p>
<p>flat, treeless area. I don't think anyone was caught out in it more </p>
<p>than once. We learned rapidly to keep track of the time, and </p>
<p>especially to get inside of some structure when we saw the brown fog </p>
<p>rolling across the desert.</p>
<p>The authorities had been kind and had sent to Ak-Bulak the first </p>
<p>bathtub that town had ever seen. This was installed in a steam </p>
<p>bathhouse that, so far as we saw, was little used, and we had the </p>
<p>place to ourselves twice a week. There were no proper faucets, but </p>
<p>hot and cold pipes with valves stuck straight out over the end of </p>
<p>the tub. The cold water behaved reasonably well, but the hot pipe </p>
<p>sent forth a horizontal geyser of about eighty percent steam and </p>
<p>twenty percent boiling water, because it came directly from the </p>
<p>boiler for the steam bath. This stream would shoot across the tub </p>
<p>from end to end with very little falling into it. Judicious </p>
<p>deflection with a bit of board would cause some of the hot water to </p>
<p>fall into the tub, and a suitable temperature could gradually be </p>
<p>attained. There was no stopper for the tub but someone had whittled </p>
<p>the end of a block of wood so that it served fairly well. At the end </p>
<p>of one's first bath, he got out and pulled the plug. He then found </p>
<p>that there was no drainpipe, as the dirty water gushed out over the </p>
<p>mud floor and over his feet. Washing them required at least part of </p>
<p>a second bath. A lattice of slats high enough to keep the bather </p>
<p>above high tide level presently solved this problem. On a twice a </p>
<p>week schedule in such a climate we really needed these baths. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the walk back to our siding in the sand and the heat </p>
<p>often made us feel ready for another bath by the time we got there.</p>
<p>The Kazakh, Tatar, and Bashkir majority of the male population </p>
<p>apparently solved the problems of heat and cold by being sewn into </p>
<p>their sheepskins and wearing felt boots which they may, for all I </p>
<p>know, have taken off at night. Much of their clothing seemed to be </p>
<p>changed only when it fell apart. I dare say that if one is careful </p>
<p>not to move rapidly, the sheepskins may keep out heat as well as </p>
<p>cold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life in Ak-Bulak 60</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These men were certainly, for their size, the strongest I have ever </p>
<p>seen. When we brought our equipment from the freight station to our </p>
<p>operating site, a low cart drawn by two oxen was, for some reason, </p>
<p>left thirty or forty yards away down a small grade from the </p>
<p>platform. The "Mongolian" porters, who averaged about five feet </p>
<p>three inches and looked as though they might weigh a hundred pounds </p>
<p>if divested of their sheepskins, then picked up our boxes and </p>
<p>carried them to the wagon. I had weighed these in Cambridge and knew </p>
<p>that most of them were in the range from two hundred to two hundred </p>
<p>and fifty pounds. One of our boxes was too much for them. It </p>
<p>contained a large relay rack and a heavy power supply and was built </p>
<p>into a box that looked like a privy. It weighed over four hundred </p>
<p>pounds. The solution for carrying this box was to have two of the </p>
<p>porters pick it up and lay it on the back of a third, who then </p>
<p>carried it to the wagon where two others unloaded him.</p>
<p>The local women usually wore long, heavy, and full skirts. We saw </p>
<p>them doing all kinds of work, but we ultimately decided that the </p>
<p>best wife must be the one who got out into the streets earliest in </p>
<p>the morning to collect, in her apron, part of the days accumulation </p>
<p>of camel and other dung, for drying and burning.</p>
<p>We occasionally walked a couple of miles to the bank of the Iletsk </p>
<p>River, the only body of visible water in the neighborhood. It was, </p>
<p>as will be imagined, flat and slow moving, but it did flow most of </p>
<p>the summer, and had some rushes along the banks. Here we saw many </p>
<p>birds that I took to be a kind of Arctic tern. They were, whatever </p>
<p>the kind, graceful and highly maneuverable. They darted around </p>
<p>rapidly in complicated patterns and were, as far as I can recall, </p>
<p>the only birds I noticed in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The only other non-domesticated creature that I remember seeing in </p>
<p>Kazakhstan was a European hedgehog that lived with us for a time. I </p>
<p>feel some doubt about the matter of domestication, but I incline to </p>
<p>believe that it simply recognized a good source of food and did not </p>
<p>object too strenuously to a modest amount of handling. I had never </p>
<p>seen such an animal and admired the almost perfect ball he could </p>
<p>form when he wished to indicate that he had had enough attention for </p>
<p>the time being. The ball was almost completely covered with spines </p>
<p>an inch or so long, but the spines were of uniform length and not so </p>
<p>sharp as those of a porcupine, so that the hedgehog could be held in </p>
<p>the hand without discomfort if no great pressure were applied. I </p>
<p>found the sensation quite different when someone induced Herkemish, </p>
<p>as we called the creature, to settle in my sleeping-bag before I </p>
<p>retired. I think Herky must have been carried at times between the </p>
<p>train and the astronomical site some ten miles away, as he was </p>
<p>certainly a pet of both astronomers and radio men; with some </p>
<p>assistance from the cooks and stewards. I recall seeing him drink </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>milk from a saucer, but somehow I have no recollection of what he </p>
<p>must have eaten. Where he was found I think I never knew.</p>
<p>Comrade Sheegin procured a lot of aluminum wire for us and we had a </p>
<p>"power" line run from the Prosobdir to our baggage car. We installed </p>
<p>our pulse transmitters, which constituted most of our power </p>
<p>requirement, in a small building beside the grain mill. The Russians </p>
<p>went so far as to whitewash the room and turn it over to us clean </p>
<p>and empty, save for a large print of Stalin in a bright red frame. </p>
<p>The power line had to carry only enough for our receivers, one small </p>
<p>communications transmitter, and a few lights. The line resistance </p>
<p>was high and the regulation bad, so we had to be careful to keep a </p>
<p>fairly constant load at the end of the line. The Russians also </p>
<p>installed for us, along the same route, two lengths of surveyed </p>
<p>Signal Corps twisted pair that we had scrounged from some Army </p>
<p>installation in the United States. We used these for our own </p>
<p>telephone and for control lines for the transmitters. After sampling </p>
<p>the Wagon-Lit beds while we were unpacking, we of the radio crew </p>
<p>settled for using our sleeping bags on the floor of the baggage car, </p>
<p>so this became our home. </p>
<p>We soon discovered that increasing the electrical load at the </p>
<p>baggage car would slow down the generator at the Prosobdir, lowering </p>
<p>its frequency and causing an apparent reduction in the height of the </p>
<p>ionized layers. We spent several hours one day making a photographic </p>
<p>record while throwing a load on and off on a time schedule, so that </p>
<p>the apparent height of the E layer was varied in the form of morse </p>
<p>characters spelling out "Hello Harry". We mailed this to Professor </p>
<p>Mimno but he never received it. I suppose the Soviets took it to be </p>
<p>a cipher message, which it really was, and censored it into the </p>
<p>nearest wastebasket.</p>
<p>Except for delays of a few days in our cabled messages to and from </p>
<p>Cambridge, censorship bothered us in only one way. Just to see what </p>
<p>would happen, I had subscribed to the New York Times for the period </p>
<p>of our stay in Ak-Bulak. Between half and two-thirds of the copies </p>
<p>arrived in reasonable time. The rest were never heard of, and we </p>
<p>deduced that the Soviets simply threw them out if they happened to </p>
<p>contain information that they did not wish to have circulated in </p>
<p>Russia.</p>
<p>Arthur Collins, of the young Collins Radio Company, had donated to </p>
<p>the expedition a fine amateur transmitter with about 250 watts of </p>
<p>power. We officially used this to communicate with the astronomical </p>
<p>branch of the expedition at its field site ten miles away. They used </p>
<p>a smaller transmitter, begged from the Bell Telephone Laboratory. </p>
<p>Since we had no licenses we simply invented our own call letters, </p>
<p>which began with U, the standard initial letter for Russian </p>
<p>stations. We used URAD for the call of the radio party and UAST for </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Communication 62</p>
<p>the astronomers.</p>
<p>We soon discovered that we could communicate, even by voice, with </p>
<p>amateurs all over Europe and northern Africa, and could occasionally </p>
<p>get through to stations in the United States. One contact was </p>
<p>especially useful to us. Olof Rydbeck, a technical-college student </p>
<p>in Stockholm, soon became a good enough friend to take messages for </p>
<p>Cambridge and cable them to Professor Mimno, returning answers by </p>
<p>the same route. This cut the time to get a question answered down </p>
<p>from several days to a few hours, by eliminating the censors. </p>
<p>Incidentally, Doc Selvidge and I called on Olof on our return trip. </p>
<p>We expected to pay him for his cablegrams but he insisted that his </p>
<p>university had taken care of this. The interesting by-product was </p>
<p>that Olof came to Harvard for a doctorate a year or two later, and </p>
<p>wrote the best thesis ever submitted there in the ionospheric field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amateur radio operators are always interested in knowing who their </p>
<p>correspondents are, and usually exchange QSL cards, which are </p>
<p>decorated post-cards confirming the time and date of each first </p>
<p>communication with a new station. We began our amateur contacts </p>
<p>rather carefully, never saying exactly who and where we were, </p>
<p>because we were very conscious of the unlicensed nature of our </p>
<p>activities. We would say something vague such as, "We are members of </p>
<p>a scientific expedition, somewhere northeast of the Caspian Sea". We </p>
<p>had not had our transmitter on the air for more than a few days </p>
<p>before the mail began to bring us QSL cards, addressed to our </p>
<p>fictitious call letters "northeast of the Caspian Sea", or using </p>
<p>whatever loose description we might have adopted. Thus we learned </p>
<p>about "Big Brother" long before we ever read "1984".</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>Every town in the Soviet Union, so far as we saw, had a Park </p>
<p>Kultura, a term always translated as "Park of Culture and Rest". In </p>
<p>a small town, such as Ak-Bulak, the culture might be represented by </p>
<p>a bandstand and a few tables for chess. In the cities, the parks </p>
<p>usually had real cultural exhibits of one kind or another. One </p>
<p>feature that was sure to be present was a circular walk surrounding </p>
<p>some object, perhaps a flagpole or a fountain. The general evening </p>
<p>recreation seemed to be to walk in pairs or in groups round and </p>
<p>round these paths, always widdershins, or counterclockwise. The same </p>
<p>phenomenon was to be seen in theaters or concert halls, where there </p>
<p>was usuaUy a lobby nearly as large as the auditorium. During </p>
<p>intermissions the entire audience would adjourn to the lobby and </p>
<p>walk counterclockwise around a large pot of ferns, or a statue, or </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Diversions">Diversions in Ak-Bulak</b> </a>63</p>
<p>some other object in the center.</p>
<p>In Ak-Bulak the Park Kultura covered an acre or two and was planted </p>
<p>thinly with bushes and small trees. In the center was the bandstand, </p>
<p>surrounded by a circular boardwalk ten or twelve feet wide and </p>
<p>perhaps twenty-five yards in diameter. Once or twice in a six-day </p>
<p>week the local band would play for most of the long summer evening, </p>
<p>and the young people would walk round and round. The band was fairly </p>
<p>bad and was not noticeably improved when Doc Selvidge took over one </p>
<p>of the trumpets.</p>
<p>Paul King had brought with him two or three cases of canned apple </p>
<p>sauce which he could not often be induced to share with the rest of </p>
<p>us. Late one evening, after walking in the park, Paul and I managed </p>
<p>to abstract a couple of local girls from among their friends. Not </p>
<p>being able to think of any other objective, we decided to treat them </p>
<p>to some of Paul's apple sauce. Our actions had not gone unobserved, </p>
<p>and we soon discovered that we were being trailed by Doc and one or </p>
<p>two other Americans and by a somewhat larger group of Soviet youths. </p>
<p>We dodged our pursuit well enough to reach the train and get a few </p>
<p>tins of apple sauce and a can opener, but it seemed counter-</p>
<p>productive (if I may use a more modern term) to try to stay there. </p>
<p>We dragged the girls down a side street and presently found a house </p>
<p>with a sort of courtyard surrounded by an adobe wall. This seemed </p>
<p>quiet and secure enough, so we slipped inside. Finding a mound in </p>
<p>the corner, we sat down and opened the cans just as it began to </p>
<p>rain. Because we had no alternate objective, and as the girls </p>
<p>obviously liked the apple sauce, we stayed until realization of our </p>
<p>silly situation began to dawn on us. Investigation quickly proved </p>
<p>our suspicion correct that we were sitting on a Russian dung-hill in </p>
<p>the rain, eating apple sauce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my limited experience, there is no deadline so severely exacting </p>
<p>as a solar eclipse. After months or years of arduous preparation, </p>
<p>and after travelling thousands of hot and dusty miles to work under </p>
<p>primitive conditions, no excuse for delay can be offered. One must </p>
<p>have everything operating well at exactly the right time. At home, </p>
<p>one never works so hard and so long. One of the irritating features </p>
<p>is that it is never possible to convince the folks at home of this. </p>
<p>It is always assumed that you were just away there, in an </p>
<p>interesting part of the world, having a high old time at someone </p>
<p>else's expense.</p>
<p>This pressure, assisted by the Soviet calendar which was then </p>
<p>arranged in groups of six days so that one soon lost track of the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diversions in Ak-Bulak / <a name="Catherine">Catherine Stillman</a>! 64</p>
<p>day of the week, must account for the fact that I can assign no </p>
<p>dates to any happenings in that period, except for the day of the </p>
<p>eclipse itself. Thus I am unable to establish the date of the most </p>
<p>important event of the expedition, when one of the thrice-weekly </p>
<p>trains brought Catherine Stillman to Ak-Bulak. Catherine had had to </p>
<p>finish her spring term, teaching astronomy at Vassar, before coming </p>
<p>to Russia a few days before the eclipse. In spite of the pressure of </p>
<p>work on both of us, it did not take her long to make me begin to </p>
<p>reconsider my ideas about the desirability of the married state. It </p>
<p>must have been even before the eclipse that she granted me the first </p>
<p>of myriads of kisses (that become more and more important to me as </p>
<p>the years go by) in the only grove of willow trees anywhere in the </p>
<p>neighborhood of Ak-Bulak.</p>
<p>Most of our food in Kazakhstan was far below the standard of the </p>
<p>Astoria Hotel, occasionally descending as low as camel meat, which </p>
<p>is not to be recommended. One Russian custom bothered us greatly; </p>
<p>they liked to hang their chicken for weeks before serving it. After </p>
<p>many efforts we finally convinced the management that we were </p>
<p>serious, and a great day came when Peter, our usual waiter, brought </p>
<p>in a platter of chicken and, bending his head far to the side and </p>
<p>making a chopping motion at his neck with the opposite hand, </p>
<p>announced loudly, "Sevodnya" (today). Peter, incidentally, was </p>
<p>approaching his twenty-first birth day and was anxious to get back </p>
<p>to Moscow to marry his fifth wife. This was in the days when, in the </p>
<p>words of Will Rogers, one could get a divorce at the post office and </p>
<p>then send his spouse a card saying, "You aren't with us any more".</p>
<p>At times we were served a fine dessert, a rum cake, but </p>
<p>unfortunately the thick butter frosting suffered seriously on the </p>
<p>long hot trip from Moscow. We quickly learned to scrape off the </p>
<p>icing, leave it on the plate, and enjoy the cake. One late-arriving </p>
<p>physicist and his wife had this comestible served before it had </p>
<p>occurred to any of us to warn them. The cake was beautiful and the </p>
<p>husband took a large mouthful. He chewed more and more slowly with a </p>
<p>strained look developing on his face. After a long time and a final </p>
<p>gulp, he turned to his wife and said, "I say, Marian, do you suppose </p>
<p>they make this dressing with Roquefort cheese?" </p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>These diversions notwithstanding, the eclipse was upon us. All of </p>
<p>the equipment was working well, although I was not. Everyone on the </p>
<p>expedition, I think, had a bout with dysentery at some time or </p>
<p>other. Mine chose to hit me the night before the eclipse. This had </p>
<p>one pleasant result. We boys exchanged jobs at the last minute to </p>
<p>give me the least demanding one, which was standing watch over the </p>
<p>transmitters at the Prosobdir in case there should be trouble with </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Teaparty">Eclipse Day / The "Comradely Tea Party" </a>65</p>
<p>either of them. I could easily do this from outside the open window, </p>
<p>so that I had an excellent view of the eclipse instead of being </p>
<p>trapped inside the baggage car operating part of the receiving </p>
<p>equipment. It may be that my fever accentuated what I saw, but the </p>
<p>eclipse was surely one of the most beautiful and spectacular in this </p>
<p>century. I was amazed to see the corona, which conveniently arranged </p>
<p>itself in the form of a five-pointed star in honor of the Soviet </p>
<p>symbol, fully fifteen seconds before totality began. The pearly </p>
<p>light of the corona, the orange light around the horizon, the </p>
<p>visibility of stars and planets, and the shadow bands sweeping </p>
<p>across the desert were all the best I have ever seen, and more awe-</p>
<p>inspiring than any description I have read. When the eclipse period </p>
<p>was over, I allowed myself to collapse for a day or two.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the radio observations suffered the equivalent of </p>
<p>poor visibility for astronomers, as a major magnetic storm began a </p>
<p>few hours before the eclipse. This meant that we could not be sure </p>
<p>whether the effects we measured were pure eclipse phenomena or </p>
<p>whether they were contaminated by erratic magnetic activity. As a </p>
<p>result, it was inadvisable to publish any results of the ionospheric </p>
<p>work until after 194O, when it was possible to mount a similar radio </p>
<p>expedition. It then turned out that most of the 1936 effects were in </p>
<p>fact caused by the eclipse. Before this confirmation, fortunately, </p>
<p>the work in Ak-Bulak had helped King and Selvidge to get their </p>
<p>doctor's degrees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next memorable event was a reception given by the Orenburg </p>
<p>Oblast (the equivalent of a state government, perhaps) for the four </p>
<p>or five expeditions in the Orenburg district. This was introduced to </p>
<p>us, in a masterpiece of inadequate translation, by invitations to a </p>
<p>"comradely tea party". I have a feeling that this was to be three </p>
<p>days after the eclipse although, as I have said, all dates are </p>
<p>nebulous during this period.</p>
<p>In accordance with our instructions, we took a train for the four or </p>
<p>five hour ride to Orenburg, in time to get there in the middle of </p>
<p>the afternoon. This trip and the return ride later were the only </p>
<p>times I was trapped in a Soviet third-class sleeping car, which can </p>
<p>be described as a box car with two layers of shelves eighteen inches </p>
<p>wide along the walls. There were no mattresses or blankets. On </p>
<p>arrival in Orenburg we were taken to what I believe was the city </p>
<p>hall, where we were supplied with soft drinks and cookies and had </p>
<p>appropriate speeches made to us. We were given to understand that we </p>
<p>were greatly honored by being allowed to shake the hand of the </p>
<p>Governor of the Oblast, who was credited with being the man who had </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eclipse Day / The "Comradely Tea Party" 66</p>
<p>shot the last Tsar at Ekaterinburg. After this honor, we were turned </p>
<p>loose for two or three hours to go sightseeing or, if we liked, to </p>
<p>try the parachute jumps in the Park of Culture and Rest.</p>
<p>We assembled at about eight o'clock in another hall, two or three </p>
<p>blocks from the first one, where we found a U-shaped table set for </p>
<p>dinner for two or three hundred guests. The table was a sight I </p>
<p>cannot forget. It was nearly five feet wide. Each place setting had, </p>
<p>in the Russian fashion, one knife and one fork and a stack of plates </p>
<p>several inches high. We found that after each course the top plate </p>
<p>was removed. This is an advantage, because one can, as distention </p>
<p>sets in, count the remaining plates and summon up the stamina to see </p>
<p>one through the rest of the meal. Arranged around the stack of </p>
<p>plates was a series of nine glasses, ranging from liqueur size </p>
<p>upward. At intervals along the table were vases of flowers and some </p>
<p>dishes of smoked sturgeon and caviar. Except for these few </p>
<p>decorations, every available decimeter on the table cloth had an </p>
<p>open bottle standing on it. I discovered that, without stretching to </p>
<p>an impolite extent, I could reach nineteen varieties of wines and </p>
<p>liquors, not counting duplications.</p>
<p>The dinner went on and on, with official toasts (in Russian, </p>
<p>English, French, and Czechoslovakian) proclaimed from the head table </p>
<p>every few minutes. I made a tactical error in deciding that it would </p>
<p>be courteous to drink all of the official toasts in vodka, and soon </p>
<p>became too stubborn to change my mind. I had, of course, secured a </p>
<p>seat beside Catherine. I thus found myself needing to sample the </p>
<p>other eighteen potables in private toasts to her beautiful brown </p>
<p>eyes, or to whatever other parts of her anatomy appealed to my </p>
<p>imagination from time to time.</p>
<p>We were all, naturally, overtired, especially the astronomers who </p>
<p>had been developing photographic plates and trying to pack for their </p>
<p>departure all at the same time. One of them, an Englishman from the </p>
<p>Greenwich Observatory (whom I had the pleasure of meeting in </p>
<p>Washington, years later, when he had become the great British expert </p>
<p>on de-gaussing ships to protect them from magnetic mines) exhibited </p>
<p>a remarkable ability to sleep through most of the proceedings </p>
<p>without ever losing his erect posture or nodding his head. Most of </p>
<p>us, although drooping to some extent, managed to continue our </p>
<p>drinking.</p>
<p>It was perhaps fortunate that our expedition had to abandon the </p>
<p>party in the middle, at about three A.M., as we needed to catch our </p>
<p>return train to Ak-Bulak. When we prepared to leave for the railroad </p>
<p>station, Catherine confessed that she had left her coat at the City </p>
<p>Hall, so we set out on foot to retrieve it, although I have no idea </p>
<p>why we thought we could even find the hall, to say nothing of </p>
<p>finding it open. I seem to recall that the big street we had to </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comradely Tea Party, continued 67</p>
<p>follow resembled Fifth Avenue in the Forties. I am more sure that </p>
<p>the space between the curbs was just about wide enough to contain </p>
<p>our meanderings as we held each other up and kept pointed in more or </p>
<p>less the right direction. In some unexplained way, we retrieved the </p>
<p>coat and got back to find a car that would take us to the railroad </p>
<p>station.</p>
<p>When we got into our train, it seemed good to me to lie down on the </p>
<p>nearest shelf. It had happened that on the way to Orenburg I had </p>
<p>occupied an upper shelf, with Catherine below me. Possibly as a </p>
<p>result of too much alcohol, Catherine's normal consideration for </p>
<p>others seemed to have been weakened. She took the position that I </p>
<p>was in her place and that I should get onto the upper shelf. Such an </p>
<p>effort was too much for me to consider at that time. Catherine sat </p>
<p>on the narrow edge of the shelf and annoyed me greatly. I could </p>
<p>never remember what she must have said to stir me to such a supreme </p>
<p>effort, but finally I got up, with whatever hauteur I could manage </p>
<p>under the circumstances, and I climbed into the upper berth. </p>
<p>Catherine had had to stand to let me perform this feat so that, when </p>
<p>I lay down on my proper shelf, I found her with her head only a foot </p>
<p>or so from mine. This stimulated an excellent idea, so I stretched </p>
<p>out a long arm and gathered her in for a good I night kiss. When I </p>
<p>had occasion to look up from this, I found that we were surrounded </p>
<p>by an admiring semi-circle of expedition members whom I do not </p>
<p>remember having noticed before. At this point I performed what I </p>
<p>have always maintained was the only possible action I could think of </p>
<p>for a gentleman under the circumstances: I passed out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a virtue of vodka that it leaves no hangover. I awoke in Ak-</p>
<p>Bulak, after only a few hours of sleep, feeling fit and ready to go </p>
<p>to work. The only untoward effect of the party was that an English </p>
<p>couple came around later in the day to congratulate Catherine and me </p>
<p>on our engagement. What can have given them such an idea I cannot </p>
<p>imagine, for that milestone was not reached until a couple of years </p>
<p>later.</p>
<p>Immediately after the "tea party" the astronomers, including </p>
<p>Catherine, left Ak-Bulak, while we radio people stayed on for a few </p>
<p>days to finish taking our control data. This period is chiefly </p>
<p>memorable for our acquisition of rubles. It seemed that the staff of </p>
<p>our train and a few of the townspeople were avid to buy almost </p>
<p>anything. Doc had a lot of ten cent pens that he had brought along </p>
<p>as gifts. These he sold for the equivalent of about three dollars </p>
<p>each. I happened to have a pair of new Abercrombie and Fitch brown </p>
<p>oxfords that I had bought as a spare, in Filene's Basement for </p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="Return"></p>
<p>Return from Ak-Bulak </a>68</p>
<p>$2.95. I had to stop the bidding for these at about fifty dollars </p>
<p>"worth" of rubles because my conscience hurt me. We sold everything </p>
<p>we didn't actually need, not considering that all our expenses in </p>
<p>the Soviet Union had been paid in advance and that the ruble was </p>
<p>worth nothing elsewhere. Paul did the best, as he had brought an </p>
<p>excellent collection of personal tools. My finest effort was to sell </p>
<p>Comrade Sheegin, for 850 rubles, our donated twisted pair wire, as </p>
<p>it seemed far easier to sell it than to take it down. In all, we </p>
<p>three had a fund of seven thousand rubles when we left Ak-Bulak.</p>
<p>It was now time to declare a holiday, so we took the train to </p>
<p>Kuibishev and embarked for a five-day trip up the Volga River. The </p>
<p>ship was a venerable side-wheeler, powered by another 1898 vintage </p>
<p>German diesel engine. This was far different from our old friend at </p>
<p>the Prosobdir. It had sixteen cylinders of four or five inch bore </p>
<p>and a stroke that seemed to be about four feet; it looked rather </p>
<p>like a grove of saplings. We judged that the toilets might have been </p>
<p>reasonably clean when the ship had begun its trip, but after a </p>
<p>couple of days they became totally unusable. Fortunately, there was </p>
<p>always the railing and, with care, one could often manage to wait </p>
<p>until nightfall. When we described this difficulty at the Embassy in </p>
<p>Moscow, we were told about an item in a recent issue of Krocodil. </p>
<p>the Soviet humor magazine. The article described the plight of a </p>
<p>Russian reporter travelling in Germany, where the public toilets had </p>
<p>to be flushed before the door of the cubicle could be unlocked. The </p>
<p>author described in harrowing terms the hours he spent shouting for </p>
<p>help before someone who spoke Russian came by outside and explained </p>
<p>to him how to get out.</p>
<p>The most interesting sights on the Volga were immense rafts of logs, </p>
<p>often half a mile or more in length. These had as many as three or </p>
<p>four log cabins built on them, where whole families lived for the </p>
<p>several months it took to drift down the whole course of the river. </p>
<p>Another interesting sight was the "Alabaster Mountain" somewhere </p>
<p>along the western bank. This is hardly a mountain, being perhaps </p>
<p>eight or nine hundred feet high, but it has smooth and elegant </p>
<p>contours, and stands out in a flat river valley. It was about half </p>
<p>grass-covered, but the other half was exposed alabaster that gleamed </p>
<p>in the sunlight. I was disappointed not to hear "the Song of the </p>
<p>Volga Boatmen" at any time during the trip. I remedied this defect, </p>
<p>as far as possible, by singing it myself from the stern of the upper </p>
<p>deck, to only moderate applause.</p>
<p>Our best sightseeing on the voyage was at Kazan, the old Tatar </p>
<p>capital. This is a city of beautiful old brick, largely built in the </p>
<p>fifteenth century. We had a queasy time when, after climbing nearly </p>
<p>two hundred feet up the inside of a brick minaret, we looked down </p>
<p>from the little balcony and found that the top of the tower was only </p>
<p>four or five feet in diameter and was warped several feet out of the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Picnic">Along the Volga / Picnic</a> 69</p>
<p>vertical. At Gorki, the former Nizhni Novgorod, we visited the old </p>
<p>cathedrals and a famous monastery and then took the night train to </p>
<p>Moscow.</p>
<p>It happened that we arrived in the capital on the morning of the </p>
<p>fourth of July. Being in sad need of American society, we made a </p>
<p>fast run to the Embassy, judging that there would be at least a </p>
<p>cocktail party on the agenda. We found, to our pleasure and </p>
<p>surprise, that some genius had decided that it would be appropriate </p>
<p>to have an old-fashioned Fourth of July picnic somewhere on the bank </p>
<p>of the Moscow River twenty or more miles out of the city. The </p>
<p>American colony at the time consisted of only forty or fifty people, </p>
<p>which was not regarded as enough for a proper picnic, so the British </p>
<p>Colony kindly joined in to make up a quorum for the celebration. The </p>
<p>picnic was to be a potluck affair, with everybody bringing </p>
<p>something, and the Embassy, I think, providing beer and lemonade. </p>
<p>When we asked what we could bring we were surprised to have everyone </p>
<p>say, "Oh, caviar". We had had so much of this delightful substance </p>
<p>that it had not occurred to us that the Embassy lived largely on </p>
<p>American canned food and regarded caviar as a rare treat.</p>
<p>We had, I may have mentioned, Intourist tickets for four meals a day </p>
<p>for our entire stay in the Soviet Union, while for nearly two months </p>
<p>in Kazakhstan we had had only three meals a day. We three boys </p>
<p>therefore went back to the Intourist desk at the Metropole Hotel. We </p>
<p>tore out whole handfuls of our unused "tea" tickets, saying to the </p>
<p>girl at the desk, "Please give us the value of these in caviar </p>
<p>sandwiches". She rose to the occasion and agreed to have them ready </p>
<p>at the appointed time. When we came for them, we found ourselves </p>
<p>well loaded. The sandwiches were made with large slices of excellent </p>
<p>white bread, and each one was filled with a half-inch layer of the </p>
<p>best black caviar. The sandwiches were stacked in rectangular </p>
<p>baskets, each of which held about a bushel, and there were six </p>
<p>baskets. When we staggered to the picnic grounds with this load, we </p>
<p>found ourselves the most popular people at the party. I doubt that </p>
<p>those who brought them ate any of these sandwiches. I remember </p>
<p>stuffing myself with baked beans, potato salad, and occasional hot </p>
<p>dogs; and seldom had anything tasted so good. When I could eat no </p>
<p>more, I found a pretty and complaisant girl who let me lie with my </p>
<p>head in her lap, dropping peanuts into my mouth whenever I cared to </p>
<p>open it. I seem to remember that she was enough of a contortionist </p>
<p>to bend down and vary the diet of peanuts with an occasional kiss; I </p>
<p>suppose because young American men, like so many other staples, were </p>
<p>in short supply that year.</p>
<p>The Russians at a neighboring beach interested us. 1936 was the </p>
<p>first year in which bathing suits were made and sold in any quantity </p>
<p>in the Soviet Union. About a third of those at the beach showed a </p>
<p>marked Moscow tendency to pose and strut, so that they could easily </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Moscow70">Moscow </a>70</p>
<p>be admired. The nude majority went about their business, swimming, </p>
<p>playing, or eating, with complete nonchalance; but we fancied that </p>
<p>we detected a compulsion to fail to notice their comrades in their </p>
<p>bathing suits.</p>
<p>A Russian photographer was in attendance at the picnic. We had made </p>
<p>his acquaintance on our way to Ak-Bulak, when he had taken pictures </p>
<p>of us all at the Embassy. That was his favorite hunting ground, as </p>
<p>his chief occupation was photographing incoming visitors in the sure </p>
<p>knowledge that something would happen to some of them, in which case </p>
<p>he could sell his pictures to the news agencies. At the picnic he </p>
<p>was armed with an unusual Leica camera that had magazine and take-up </p>
<p>reels for two hundred and fifty feet of film. He operated this </p>
<p>device with remarkable rapidity, expecting that a few pictures in a </p>
<p>thousand would be useful. I watched him carefully and found that he </p>
<p>could easily take two or three pictures during the swing of a </p>
<p>softball bat.</p>
<p>Paul and Doc, who were camera buffs, and I, who was not, spent an </p>
<p>evening in this photographer's home and laboratory, with remarkable </p>
<p>linguistic effects. I, for example, knew some French and had a few </p>
<p>words of German, while his abilities were reversed. I would try to </p>
<p>find the key words in Russian with no success, then grope for German </p>
<p>ones, and perhaps find them in French. If all else failed I would </p>
<p>use English. Any sentence became a blend of two or three languages, </p>
<p>with little or no attention paid to grammatical rules. Surprisingly, </p>
<p>the overall communication was quite satisfactory, although slow. At </p>
<p>one point during the evening, after much thought, I produced a </p>
<p>triumphant statement that included at least traces of all four </p>
<p>languages. The photographer, on hearing this, set down his glass and </p>
<p>rose to his feet. With a click of his heels, he bowed deeply to me </p>
<p>and said, "Sie machen ein sehr gut salade!" </p>
<p>One evening Paul and I had an idea that it would be fun to visit the </p>
<p>Gypsy Theater. Time did not permit getting tickets and sending an </p>
<p>Intourist guide with us, in the ordinary way. An Intourist girl </p>
<p>telephoned the theater and told us which bus to take to get there. </p>
<p>She also gave us a slip of paper with, we understood, the address </p>
<p>written on it in Russian. We walked across the large square in front </p>
<p>of the Metropole Hotel and found a bus with the correct number </p>
<p>waiting at the expected corner. Before the bus started, the </p>
<p>conductress came to collect our fare. We presented our slip of </p>
<p>paper, but it did not seem to tell her all she wished to know. First </p>
<p>one, then two, then half a dozen passengers examined the paper with </p>
<p>puzzled looks. The discussion soon became general and continued for </p>
<p>several minutes. Finally it seemed that a consensus had been </p>
<p>achieved. The bus started up and drove around the square to the </p>
<p>front of the Metropole, where we were politely put off; we never </p>
<p>found out why. The bus then continued around the square to its </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Democracy">Seeds of Democracy / Equipment Inspection </a>71</p>
<p>original starting point, and immediately went off on its proper </p>
<p>route. Having found the bus unsatisfactory, Paul and I started out </p>
<p>on foot. We succeeded in finding the theater but, of course, were </p>
<p>late. The manager, an obvious Gypsy with a villainous Fu-Manchu </p>
<p>moustache, took us into the totally-dark auditorium and pushed us </p>
<p>into seats in the last row, where we sat and wondered what the </p>
<p>Pushkin play was about, through the remainder of the first act. At </p>
<p>intermission, when the lights came up, the manager came back and </p>
<p>beckoned to us. We followed him down the aisle while he looked </p>
<p>around in the crowded auditorium. Apparently deciding that the </p>
<p>center of the third row was best he went into that row and dragged </p>
<p>out two men by the collars of their coats. Motioning to them to go </p>
<p>up the aisle to the back of the theater, he bowed us into the </p>
<p>vacated seats from which we watched the rest of the play.</p>
<p>The bus episode had showed us an interesting tendency for a group of </p>
<p>Russians to assume that they had the right to decide a question by </p>
<p>majority vote. I later saw a beautiful example of this in Leningrad. </p>
<p>The trolley cars there were unbelievably crowded, and the rule I was </p>
<p>that one entered at the back and worked his way through to get off </p>
<p>at the front. The only exception to this regulation was in favor of </p>
<p>a pregnant woman, who could get on at the front provided that she </p>
<p>had the appropriate card certifying to her condition. I had the </p>
<p>great good fortune to be at the curb at a trolley stop when an </p>
<p>obviously pregnant woman tried to get on at the front of a car. She </p>
<p>did not, for some reason, have the required card, and a violent </p>
<p>altercation began between the woman and the conductor. As this </p>
<p>continued, the car gradually emptied until all of the passengers </p>
<p>surrounded the disputants. After fully fifteen minutes of general, </p>
<p>and loud, discussion, the problem was put to a vote. The majority </p>
<p>ruled that the woman should be allowed to get on at the front, so </p>
<p>the conductor yielded and she got onto the empty car. All the other </p>
<p>passengers obediently got on at the back, until the car was as </p>
<p>crowded as before and started up on its route, if not on its </p>
<p>schedule.</p>
<p>We had a feeling of having had enough of the Soviet Union, so we did </p>
<p>not stay long to see the sights of Moscow, but pushed on to </p>
<p>Leningrad. It was well that we did so, as it took us nearly three </p>
<p>weeks to get our equipment released and put onto a ship to England. </p>
<p>The chief difficulty was apparently that they were busy liquidating </p>
<p>Trotskyites that year and had, perhaps fortuitously, disposed of the </p>
<p>people who had I authorized bringing our equipment into the country. </p>
<p>About all we could do was to try to identify the officials who were </p>
<p>probably blocking our departure, and to scream and yell at them. We </p>
<p>had, by this time, I learned the Russian debating technique and did </p>
<p>not hesitate to make ourselves as loud and obnoxious as possible to </p>
<p>people who, we believed, had the power to set us on our way. Because </p>
<p>I had had this experience, Chairman Kruschev's performance at the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeds of Democracy / Equipment Inspection 72</p>
<p>United Nations in 1960 was no surprise to me.</p>
<p>It was finally arranged that the equipment would be released, but </p>
<p>only after it had been inspected. This annoyed us, as inspection I </p>
<p>had not been required when we came to the Soviet Union and we could </p>
<p>not see how they could determine that we were taking out only the </p>
<p>same things. The inspection was to take place at the dock, to which </p>
<p>our gear was transferred from the railroad station. I have already </p>
<p>mentioned the weight of some of our boxes. They were all </p>
<p>exceptionally sturdy, having been made expressly for the job by the </p>
<p>lab's excellent carpenter, Billy Kennealy. All the covers were put </p>
<p>on with large numbers of 3-1/2 inch wood screws, set up firmly by a </p>
<p>brace and screwdriver bit.</p>
<p>We spent part of a day watching a group of teen-aged youths </p>
<p>wrestling with these screws with only small hand screwdrivers. We </p>
<p>finally took pity on them and told them which box to open to find </p>
<p>braces and bits, chiefly because the operation was so time </p>
<p>consuming. In the end, every box had been opened. For each case, the </p>
<p>inspectors took out all the screws except one at a corner. Then they </p>
<p>pivoted the cover around and looked solemnly at the exposed surface </p>
<p>of the excelsior in which the contents were packed. After this </p>
<p>"inspection" the cover was returned and screwed down again. We could </p>
<p>only account for this performance by assuming that the inspectors </p>
<p>had received two conflicting sets of instructions. One must have </p>
<p>demanded "Open every box", while the other said, "Do not look at </p>
<p>anything". If this hypothesis is correct, the inspectors complied </p>
<p>with both orders. The operation took three days, because we did </p>
<p>little to help. On the last day of the inspection we had an </p>
<p>opportunity to see a Soviet air-raid drill at close hand. Before </p>
<p>this happened we had spent as little time as possible in the </p>
<p>warehouse because it smelled so bad. We would excuse ourselves </p>
<p>often, to get outside where the air was better. Apparently the </p>
<p>authorities had had trouble getting the dockyard workers to find and </p>
<p>wear their gas masks for a drill. They had solved this problem </p>
<p>beautifully. As the sirens sounded, a couple of companies of Red </p>
<p>Army soldiers swept through the dockyard area, setting off tear gas </p>
<p>bombs every few yards. The response was all that could be asked, but </p>
<p>it seemed that there were no gas masks for any foreigners who </p>
<p>happened to be in the area. For the rest of the drill, we were to be </p>
<p>found not only inside the warehouse but in the furthest and most </p>
<p>airless cubicles we could find.</p>
<p>When not occupied with these efforts to get our equipment released, </p>
<p>we were struggling with the problems posed by our stock of rubles. </p>
<p>We quickly found that we could not drink enough to make serious </p>
<p>inroads on the supply of money, and we could seldom find any </p>
<p>souvenirs worth buying. There were some nice things in the stores, </p>
<p>but at prices that shocked us. The Soviet system seemed to provide </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>the absolute necessities of life very cheaply, as was appropriate in </p>
<p>a society where the average wage was about one hundred rubles a </p>
<p>month, which was I officially equivalent to twenty dollars. Cabbage </p>
<p>and sausage cost only kopecks, and rent for the typical family </p>
<p>(usually sharing an apartment with others) might be $3.00 a month. </p>
<p>Beyond these necessities, the government stores sold "luxury" items </p>
<p>at completely fictitious prices. Cakes of soap, on the market for </p>
<p>the first time that year, cost two or three dollars each. I was </p>
<p>fascinated by the number of excellent silver cigarette cases </p>
<p>displayed in stores in all the cities we visited. These were </p>
<p>beautifully enameled with the hammer and sickle, the red star, </p>
<p>sheaves of wheat, and so on. The equivalent in the United States </p>
<p>would easily haye been worth twenty five dollars at that time. The </p>
<p>Russian price was $375.00. There were even plenty of diamond </p>
<p>bracelets and necklaces on display. We could not imagine who was </p>
<p>supposed to buy these at the prices quoted. We came to realize that </p>
<p>this was an ingenious system. The Soviet citizen could brag about </p>
<p>how low his taxes were, but if he had any money left after his basic </p>
<p>needs had been met, it found its way back into the hands of the </p>
<p>government. To get rid of our rubles, we sometimes resorted to the </p>
<p>unethical and illegal practice of catching incoming American </p>
<p>tourists before they had discovered that they had essentially no </p>
<p>need for Soviet money. We would get them into a corner of the hotel </p>
<p>lobby, behind the potted palms, and sell them almost any quantity of </p>
<p>rubles for a twenty dollar bill. My best idea for disposing of </p>
<p>rubles was to prepay our freight charges rather than to ship it </p>
<p>collect as had been previously arranged. I reasoned that I would be </p>
<p>reimbursed from expedition funds in dollars when I got home. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the same idea had occurred to the leader of the </p>
<p>expedition and he also had prepaid the freight charges. I thus lost </p>
<p>my money. Even worse, I did not have enough rubles for the </p>
<p>transaction and was forced to borrow a few hundred from Paul. After </p>
<p>I got back, I had to scrimp for quite a while to repay Paul one </p>
<p>hundred dollars or so, American money.</p>
<p>It was probably in trying to get rid of rubles that I met an </p>
<p>American girl who claimed some understanding of art. There may have </p>
<p>been something defective about this pretension, as she had not </p>
<p>visited the Hermitage Museum although she was soon leaving for </p>
<p>Moscow. In any case, I insisted that she must see the museum, which </p>
<p>I had visited several times, so we went there together. It quickly </p>
<p>became apparent that I knew nothing about art, as I admired all the </p>
<p>wrong things. The attitude of my new acquaintance was so crisp and </p>
<p>superior that I quickly fell into a game of liking, or pretending to </p>
<p>like, the things that I thought would irritate her most. I did very </p>
<p>well by becoming ecstatic about Canaletti or some of the others who </p>
<p>painted with geometrically perfect perspective and microscopic </p>
<p>detail. My best (and last) achievement was when I chose to criticize </p>
<p>Rembrandt's "Prodigal Son". This is a lovely painting of the old </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Art">Understanding Art </a>74</p>
<p>man, having the doorway of the house just, suggested behind him and </p>
<p>with the son kneeling at his feet, back to the observer.</p>
<p>The whole painting is dark, except for the father's face which is, </p>
<p>without doubt, a magnificent study. I chose to criticize the picture </p>
<p>on the ground that the light on the face seemed to come in part from </p>
<p>above and in part from lights, or reflecting surfaces, near the </p>
<p>ground on both sides. There could, in my argument, be no natural </p>
<p>setting for the picture in which the lights could have fallen in </p>
<p>this way. Therefore it was a bad picture! This attitude about a very </p>
<p>famous painting was too much for the girl to stand. She left in a </p>
<p>huff and marched completely out of my life.</p>
<p>It happened that there had been one gentleman in that last gallery </p>
<p>with us. He had apparently listened to our argument with some </p>
<p>amusement and, when the girl departed, he took up the conversation </p>
<p>where she had left it. He seemed interested in my views about </p>
<p>illumination and we were soon engrossed enough in the subject to </p>
<p>spend two hours or so wandering around discussing the lighting of </p>
<p>various works of art. We got on so well together that we introduced </p>
<p>ourselves before leaving the museum. I felt proud that I had been </p>
<p>able to uphold my end of the conversation when I discovered that he </p>
<p>was Rene Clair, the famous French movie director.</p>
<p>Soviet propaganda was evident in many forms: "Workers of the World, </p>
<p>Unite!" in Russian, German, French, or English, across the facades </p>
<p>of innumerable buildings; pictures everywhere of a smiling "Uncle </p>
<p>Joe" Stalin, pipe in mouth and with children on his knee (this at </p>
<p>the height of the Trotskyite purges); loudspeakers in many public </p>
<p>places, booming out Party speeches and slogans. We never could </p>
<p>detect that anyone paid much attention to the latter, or perhaps to </p>
<p>any of these. Probably a continual bombardment of propaganda is like </p>
<p>much of our "background" music; it may impinge on the ears, but a </p>
<p>merciful barricade develops between the ears and the cerebral </p>
<p>cortex.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that censorship was much more important than </p>
<p>propaganda. Early in our lives we develop a strong feeling that our </p>
<p>home, or language, or country is best. Because anything strange </p>
<p>seems inferior, it takes self discipline as well as experience and </p>
<p>study before we can accept the fact that a foreign thing or idea can </p>
<p>be superior to a familiar one. I once spent a long. and interesting </p>
<p>evening trying to convince a group of young Russians (some of whom </p>
<p>spoke good English) that British railroad trains were cleaner, </p>
<p>faster, and generally better than Russian ones. The experiment was a </p>
<p>total failure, as none of them had ever seen or heard of a British </p>
<p>train and automatically "knew" that the Russian trains were the best </p>
<p>in the world.</p>

<p>At some time in the past I believe the Russians held the world </p>
<p>record for the height of a balloon ascension. This record had been </p>
<p>broken most recently by Commander Settle in 1933 and again by </p>
<p>Captain Stevens in 1935. I spent a little time in several places in </p>
<p>the Soviet Union trying to find someone who knew that the Russian </p>
<p>record had been superseded, entirely without success. Everyone I </p>
<p>talked to exuded a serene confidence in the superiority of Soviet </p>
<p>aeronautics because of this and other records they were "known" to </p>
<p>hold. One cannot, of course, successfully argue about superiority in </p>
<p>art or literature. It was not impossible, however, to find instances </p>
<p>of practical things where the Russian way seemed better than the </p>
<p>ways we knew about. One was the simple matter of the postage meter. </p>
<p>The Russian machine would print the postage on anything put into it, </p>
<p>letter, newspaper, or parcel, avoiding the minor complication of </p>
<p>printing on a paper tape and then having to stick the tape to a </p>
<p>parcel. There also seemed to be much to be said for the traffic </p>
<p>control "lights" that we saw in Moscow and one or two other cities. </p>
<p>These were cubes nearly three feet on a side that were hung up over </p>
<p>the intersections of the street centerlines. They had lights inside </p>
<p>that shone through translucent red, yellow, and green segments of </p>
<p>circles that nearly filled each vertical surface. Big black </p>
<p>pointers, visible at a hundred yards or more, rotated in front of </p>
<p>these sectors. As one drove down the street, it was easy to tell </p>
<p>whether the "light" would still be green when one reached the </p>
<p>corner, or whether it would be necessary to slow down or stop. With </p>
<p>this little extra foreknowledge, the traffic flowed more smoothly </p>
<p>than I was used to seeing it do at comparable traffic density.</p>
<p>While idling away some evening hours in our baggage car in Ak-Bulak, </p>
<p>Joe Boyce, a physics professor from M.I.T., and. I had formulated a </p>
<p>double hypothesis. This suggested that, if one should plot the </p>
<p>sexual desirability of the average American woman against age, he </p>
<p>would find a curve with a double maximum. It would rise rapidly to a </p>
<p>peak at about age sixteen or eighteen; then it would tend to fall a </p>
<p>little, and rise again to a somewhat higher and broader maximum at </p>
<p>perhaps age twenty-six or twenty-eight. Beyond this latter age, the </p>
<p>curve would more and more rapidly, ultimately perhaps falling into </p>
<p>the negative domain. A disinterested critic might observe that the </p>
<p>age region to which we assigned the second and higher peak was just </p>
<p>a little less than our average age at the time we formulated the </p>
<p>hypothesis. The second part of the hypothesis proposed that if one </p>
<p>plotted the corresponding function for Russian women he would </p>
<p>develop a curve with only a single maximum. This would be (in our </p>
<p>eyes) not quite so high as the first maximum of the American curve, </p>
<p>and would occur a year or two earlier. Beyond this sixteen-year </p>
<p>maximum, the Russian curve would fall continuously, like the </p>
<p>American curve beyond the age of twenty-eight. We recognized, of </p>
<p>course, that there is a great deal of individual variation in </p>
<p>desirability, and that accurate assessment becomes very difficult if </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Milli">Millimarlenes </a>76</p>
<p>the observer is in a state of deprivation, such as on a nineteenth-</p>
<p>century whaling voyage, or even on an expedition to Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>These considerations amused Joe and me, and others to whom we </p>
<p>revealed the results of our analysis, for two or three hours. The </p>
<p>subject was not explicitly considered again, however, until Doc, </p>
<p>Paul, and I were faced with killing time in Leningrad. It then </p>
<p>occurred to us that science demanded that we make at least visual </p>
<p>estimates designed to establish the form of the Russian curve; the </p>
<p>chief consideration being what the American curve could be </p>
<p>investigated at any time, while we might never be in Russia again.</p>
<p>I must explain that, of course, the absolute unit of feminine sexual </p>
<p>desirability in 1936 was the Marlene; this unit being too large for </p>
<p>practical purposes, one rated desirability in millimarlenes. As in </p>
<p>most scientific measurements, it was necessary to have a portable </p>
<p>reference standard because the absolute standard is not generally </p>
<p>accessible. In our case, this portable standard consisted in defined </p>
<p>ratings for several American girls we all knew; we agreed that Helen </p>
<p>Atwell, the only secretary at Cruft Laboratory in those days, </p>
<p>deserved the phenomenally-high value of 180 millimarlenes. After a </p>
<p>few preliminary trials, we established a standard operating </p>
<p>procedure which must be described for the benefit of future </p>
<p>experimenters. A day's run of data-taking began in the afternoon, </p>
<p>when we went to one of the appropriate emporia and bought two liters </p>
<p>of 140-proof vodka. Returning to the Astoria, we would drink one </p>
<p>third of the vodka, have some dinner and then drink a second third </p>
<p>of the vodka. This would bring us to about sunset, and we would </p>
<p>proceed to the public parks or some other region where we believed </p>
<p>that a suitable concentration of what we designated as horoshia </p>
<p>deavitchka (free translation: OK babes) might be found. Locating a </p>
<p>specimen, say one on a park bench with a sailor, we three would line </p>
<p>up at a respectful distance of eight or ten feet and assess her </p>
<p>charms. One of us might suggest, "Forty" (millimarlenes, of course). </p>
<p>The second might be more favorably impressed and. say, "No; at least </p>
<p>sixty or seventy". The third would usually establish the group </p>
<p>rating by saying, "All right, let's settle for fifty". I would </p>
<p>inscribe this number in my pocket notebook. We would then go through </p>
<p>a similar process in guessing her age. By this time, naturally, the </p>
<p>sailor might have decided to take part in the proceedings. After </p>
<p>order had been reestablished, in one way or another, we would move </p>
<p>on to the next bench, or wherever another specimen was to be found. </p>
<p>In the two or three hours of suitable illumination in the far </p>
<p>northern twilight, we might thus gather data on a couple of dozen </p>
<p>specimens. Returning to the hotel, we would drink the remaining </p>
<p>vodka and do a preliminary analysis of the day's numbers and prepare </p>
<p>a summary of all data acquired up to that time.</p>
<p>Surprising as it may sound, this simple diversion, under the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Millimarlenes / <a name="Depressing"></a>Depressing Things 77</p>
<p>influence of enough vodka, was very helpful in passing the time </p>
<p>until we were able to leave Russia. In all, we gathered data on two </p>
<p>or three hundred specimens.</p>
<p>After we had returned to the United States, someone decided that a </p>
<p>feature of a Department dinner, for faculty and graduate students, </p>
<p>should be my telling some of the stories of the eclipse expedition </p>
<p>that presumably would not be published in the scientific literature. </p>
<p>I told a number of yarns, and included among them a pseudo-</p>
<p>scientific study of the desirability of Russian women. By the time </p>
<p>of the dinner, in October, I had had the opportunity to reduce the </p>
<p>data to conventional statistical form, and I showed slides and </p>
<p>reported the appropriate values of the means, standard deviations, </p>
<p>skewness, and measures of the confidence to be felt in the results. </p>
<p>I spent perhaps fifteen minutes developing the hypothesis and </p>
<p>reporting on the "measurements". The discussion seemed to be well </p>
<p>received.</p>
<p>The next morning I was quietly working at my desk when Professor Van </p>
<p>Vleck stopped at my door. Van was a famous and powerful theoretical </p>
<p>physicist who, no doubt involuntarily, set a record for the delay </p>
<p>after which he received a Nobel Prize. It was finally awarded him in </p>
<p>1977 for work he had published about 1930. Particularly in those </p>
<p>days, Van seemed to live almost entirely in his own mind. It was </p>
<p>characteristic that only about once in ten times did he notice if </p>
<p>you passed him in a corridor and greeted him. On this occasion, he </p>
<p>spoke first, saying, "Good morning". I replied, "Good morning, sir", </p>
<p>and waited to see what he wanted. After long consideration, he said, </p>
<p>"I enjoyed your talk last night". After I had responded, "Thank you, </p>
<p>sir", he thought for what seemed at least a minute. Finally he said, </p>
<p>"Especially the part about the desirability of the Russian women". I </p>
<p>suppose I grinned or made some other appropriate response, and then </p>
<p>waited while he planned his next remark. He eventually volunteered a </p>
<p>statement, "If you are interested in the corresponding curve for the </p>
<p>Dutch, I can describe it for you, without your having to do any </p>
<p>research". Another pause followed,and finally he contributed the Van </p>
<p>Vieck hypothesis, "It passes through the origin and has a negative </p>
<p>slope".</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>One or two depressing facts about the Russian trip ought to be </p>
<p>mentioned. There were, by the time I left the country, five people </p>
<p>who had become good enough friends so that, had they lived </p>
<p>elsewhere, I should still be likely to correspond with them from </p>
<p>time to time. As it happened in this case, within a year four of </p>
<p>them had "disappeared". One or another of the expedition members </p>
<p>eventually received what was felt to be accurate word that two of </p>
<p>them had been shot. The other two simply vanished. It is hard, if </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Millimarlenes / Depressing Things 78</p>
<p>not impossible, not to believe that their major, and perhaps only, </p>
<p>fault was that they carried out their assigned duties and thereby </p>
<p>had too much to do with foreigners.</p>
<p>In Ak-Bulak we had, about twice a week, been depressed by the sight </p>
<p>of prison trains that were, for some reason, often left standing </p>
<p>near our siding for a few hours before proceeding toward the east. </p>
<p>These were long trains of small box-cars, with sliding doors that </p>
<p>were chained open about four inches. These gaps must have provided </p>
<p>some ventilation as well as permitting the passage of downward-</p>
<p>sloping pipes that, we supposed, constituted toilet facilities. We </p>
<p>could see the faces of people looking out through these gaps, but </p>
<p>the number of armed guards pacing beside the trains discouraged us </p>
<p>from close investigation, or even from showing much obvious </p>
<p>interest. We always spoke of these trains as taking prisoners to the </p>
<p>salt mines, of which there were several in our neighborhood, but we </p>
<p>never knew what kind of labor camps or prisons might be their </p>
<p>destinations.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>From many subsequent discussions I have learned that my emotional </p>
<p>reactions upon leaving the Soviet Union were not unique, but at the </p>
<p>time they surprised me. My first trip abroad had been a delight, in </p>
<p>part for reasons that have been mentioned. I had noticed no great </p>
<p>strain in Russia, although many things had irritated me and some had </p>
<p>been depressing. I was, naturally, glad to get the export </p>
<p>difficulties settled and to be on my way to Finland with Doc, Paul </p>
<p>having gone off through Poland.</p>
<p>At the time we saw it, the Finnish border was a small stream crossed </p>
<p>by a railroad bridge. The eastern half of the bridge was painted </p>
<p>red, and the western part was white. On the Soviet side, all trees </p>
<p>had been removed from an area of several square miles. The resulting </p>
<p>flat plain was nothing but an immense railway yard, obviously </p>
<p>intended for military purposes. Many of the areas between the dozens </p>
<p>of tracks were stacked with huge rolls of barbed wire. Spanning the </p>
<p>railroad line was a large wooden arch, decorated with the red star </p>
<p>and the hammer and sickle. A number of Red Army soldiers, aside from </p>
<p>those on guard, were standing around with field glasses, looking </p>
<p>across into Finland.</p>
<p>On the Finnish side, the first building was a neat white stone </p>
<p>railway station. Several large pine trees surrounded and shaded it, </p>
<p>and well trimmed flower beds provided a welcome note of color. An </p>
<p>official was raking the immaculate gravel paths. There were at least </p>
<p>a dozen young Finns, of both sexes, in the station yard. They looked </p>
<p>like high-school students and were all neatly and gaily dressed. </p>
<p>Several of them had field glasses and were looking across into </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Finagain">Finland Again </a>79</p>
<p>Russia. One could not help thinking of the only circumstances that </p>
<p>would lead to a crossing of this border, for the watchers on either </p>
<p>side.</p>
<p>The sensation I had not expected was one of seeming to expand about </p>
<p>two inches in each dimension when the train rolled slowly across the </p>
<p>bridge. I had had no idea of how much the awareness of continuous </p>
<p>surveillance had weighed upon me. There was also the remarkable </p>
<p>sensation arising from smelling pleasant fragrances for the first </p>
<p>time in months.</p>
<p>Doc and I had determined, on our former short stop in Finland, that </p>
<p>here was the place to take our vacation, because some quirk of the </p>
<p>monetary exchange made prices incredibly low. This was the deciding </p>
<p>factor because Doc, as a graduate student, had no extensive fiscal </p>
<p>resources while I was still earning $20.00 per week. I had drawn my </p>
<p>salary in advance for the duration of the expedition, but my funds </p>
<p>showed no probability of providing a surplus. As a matter of fact, </p>
<p>one of my first efforts was to telegraph our steamship agent in </p>
<p>England to see if I could advance the date of my departure for the </p>
<p>United States, but without success.</p>
<p>We left the train at Viborg, where we spent the night, and then we </p>
<p>went to Lappenranta, where we boarded a small boat for several days </p>
<p>in the Finnish lake country. This is a region where there are no </p>
<p>roads but thousands of small lakes, interconnected by canals where </p>
<p>necessary. All traffic in this district is, or was, by little </p>
<p>steamboats forty or fifty feet long. Each farm had a narrow pier, or </p>
<p>perhaps a narrow board walk, extending out into water deep enough </p>
<p>for the boats, which operated almost like trolley cars. A farmer's </p>
<p>wife might board one to take vegetables to a market a few miles </p>
<p>away. If no one in the family needed to go to the village, a </p>
<p>dairyman could leave a few cans of milk on his pier and the boatmen </p>
<p>would pick these up and take them to market for him. Boats like ours </p>
<p>had a dozen or more tiny staterooms. Because vibration would make </p>
<p>sleep impossible, these boats would tie up to a pier, or even a tree </p>
<p>stump, at ten or eleven at night. As no meals were served on board, </p>
<p>the boat would start up in the morning to bring it to the next </p>
<p>village in time for breakfast.</p>
<p>On our boat, as on others that had staterooms, there was a group of </p>
<p>students on vacation. They were almost all German, Polish, Estonian, </p>
<p>Latvian, or Lithuanian; all were good linguists, so that two or </p>
<p>three simultaneous translations would make any remark intelligible </p>
<p>to all. We did most things as a group and had a fine time. Our most </p>
<p>memorable stop was at Savonlinna, a sort of crossroads in the lake </p>
<p>country from which one could, if he were in a canoe, travel a </p>
<p>hundred miles or so in almost any direction, through one small lake </p>
<p>after another. Here is the old Swedish castle of Olavinlinna, which </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Lakes">The Finnish Lak</a>es 80</p>
<p>comes the nearest of any I have seen to being the standard fortress </p>
<p>I used to imagine as a boy. The castle covers a rocky island at the </p>
<p>outlet of a lake. It can be approached only by boat, and the swift </p>
<p>current makes the approach a job for an expert. This must be one of </p>
<p>the finest moats in the world. The views from the top of the largest </p>
<p>round tower are unforgettable. There are twelve funnel shaped holes </p>
<p>through the thick stone walls; each one frames a different and </p>
<p>delightful landscape.</p>
<p>There was one beautiful night when I decided to stay on the boat </p>
<p>instead of going to the local beer garden with the students. It was </p>
<p>a quiet evening with a magnificent sunset; fortunately so still that </p>
<p>I could sit with my feet on the rail and envelop my body with pipe </p>
<p>smoke to discourage the arctic mosquitoes. The group from our boat </p>
<p>eventually settled on the shore several hundred yards away and sang </p>
<p>student songs for two or three hours. During this time, the flaming </p>
<p>reds, oranges, and yellows of the sunset gradually swung through the </p>
<p>north and became a sunrise, without ever losing any of their </p>
<p>brilliance. We stayed with our boat as far as Kuopio and then took a </p>
<p>train to Vaala, at the mouth of another lake, where we stayed in a </p>
<p>small country hotel resembling a hunting lodge. This was the only </p>
<p>place in Finland where, for two or three hours in the afternoon, we </p>
<p>found ourselves without anyone in attendance who spoke English. In </p>
<p>the early morning we embarked for a boat trip down the Oulujoki </p>
<p>River. This is a tourist trip made in the kind of boats that were </p>
<p>formerly used to carry barrels of tar down to the Gulf of Bothnia. </p>
<p>The boats seat two abreast, are forty feet long and very flexible. I </p>
<p>had found one pulled up on the beach in the morning before we left. </p>
<p>Its bow was a little higher than my belt. I put my hand under the </p>
<p>prow and lifted it above my head, but only the front half of the </p>
<p>boat moved. We were to find that this flexibility was a great help </p>
<p>as it let the boat "flow" around rocks in the white water. The crew </p>
<p>of such a boat consists of a rower, in our case a fourteen year old </p>
<p>girl, whose chief duty is to get the boat from the shore of the lake </p>
<p>into the fast water of the river; and a helmsman with a long </p>
<p>steering oar, who is usually very busy. I estimated the speed of the </p>
<p>river, in the parts we traversed, as nearly twelve miles per hour. </p>
<p>Sometimes the banks are gently sloping and decorated with pastures </p>
<p>and cattle; in other places the river runs through forests or cuts </p>
<p>through narrow rocky gorges three or four hundred feet deep. It is a </p>
<p>thrilling, albeit wet, ride. After a stop for lunch at a restaurant </p>
<p>clinging to the side of a gorge (and approached by more steps than I </p>
<p>like to think about at my present age) the river comes to a place </p>
<p>where it flows too smoothly to be regarded as fun for the tourists. </p>
<p>They are then put ashore to be picked up by the afternoon train that </p>
<p>runs parallel to the river. After an hour or more on the train </p>
<p>another stretch of rapids is reached, and the tourists embark on a </p>
<p>second tar-boat for another twenty or thirty miles before reaching </p>
<p>the city of Oulu, at the end of a long, tiring, and exciting day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="North">In Northern Finland </a>81</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From Oulu, we took a bus toward North Cape, but the weather turned </p>
<p>cold and damp. We got as far as Rovaniemi, where we walked north for </p>
<p>two or three miles and crossed the Arctic Circle, but decided that </p>
<p>this was enough and retreated by way of the train to Helsinki. The </p>
<p>capital was as delightful as we had found it before. We stayed at </p>
<p>the Torni Hotel, where we succeeded in paying $1.10 per day. This </p>
<p>was the only place in Finland where we spent as much as a dollar for </p>
<p>lodging, the usual price in the villages having been the equivalent </p>
<p>of twenty or thirty cents. At these prices we did everything we </p>
<p>pleased, going to cabarets frequently and never stinting ourselves. </p>
<p>I found, when I left Finland, that the entire stay there, including </p>
<p>about three thousand miles of travel, had cost about $3.50 per day.</p>
<p>On leaving the Soviet Union Doc had become very Russian, in his </p>
<p>opinion. He had grown a bushy black beard and always wore a handsome </p>
<p>Russian blouse he had bought somewhere. In our travels in Finland he </p>
<p>had been forced to realize that, for some reason, he was always </p>
<p>taken to be Czechoslovakian. This hurt his pride, so in Helsinki he </p>
<p>finally gave up and shaved off his beard. He deposited the bush, </p>
<p>practically intact, in the waste basket in our room before we went </p>
<p>off on some errand. On our return he happened to look into the waste </p>
<p>basket. On top of the beard was a single square of toilet paper, </p>
<p>bearing the carefully printed word "Wonderful". This completed his </p>
<p>humiliation, but we could never find a chambermaid who would admit </p>
<p>to the editorial comment.</p>
<p>When we left Finland, we took the night boat from Turku to </p>
<p>Stockholm. This is a beautiful trip through the seagull-haunted </p>
<p>archipelago of the Aland Islands in the evening and through the </p>
<p>equally lovely islands outside of Stockholm harbor in the morning. </p>
<p>Our boat was again accompanied by a large and friendly flock of </p>
<p>seagulls. The passengers of course saw to it that the birds were </p>
<p>suitably rewarded.</p>
<p>In Stockholm we looked up Olof Rydbeck, who gave us the grand one-</p>
<p>day tour of the city, including a stop in the courtyard of the royal </p>
<p>palace so that he could exhibit for us the wire that was "His </p>
<p>Majesty's Antenna". We spent the evening in the Swedish Tivoli where </p>
<p>Olof touted me onto the most stomach-unsettling "amusement" I even </p>
<p>encountered. After this, Doc went off into Germany while I took the </p>
<p>night train to Malmo and Copenhagen.</p>
<p>The attraction in Denmark at this time was Catherine. After leaving </p>
<p>Ak-Bulak, she had gone to attend some kind of a summer school at </p>
<p>Helsingor. This fact was, to tell the truth, nearly all I knew about </p>
<p>where she was.</p>
<p>I registered at the Tourist Hotel, which had been recommended as </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Elsinore">Elsinore and Copenhagen </a>82</p>
<p>inexpensive. I found it very posh, with porters in white ties, even </p>
<p>in the morning. By the time I had filled out the long Danish </p>
<p>questionnaire and been bowed into the elevator and then into my room </p>
<p>by no less than two flunkies in tailcoats, I found that my bags had </p>
<p>not only arrived there, but had been neatly unpacked. After </p>
<p>breakfast I applied myself to the telephone with little confidence </p>
<p>in my ability to make a long-distance person-to-person call in </p>
<p>Danish. To my considerable astonishment, I presently found Catherine </p>
<p>at the other end of the wire. I promptly invited myself to Helsingor </p>
<p>for that afternoon.</p>
<p>I recollect very little of what we did that day, but I know that we </p>
<p>visited the Kronborg for I have very happy memories of sitting on </p>
<p>the edge of the parapet where Hamlet's father's ghost walked and </p>
<p>dangling our legs over the edge of the strait that separates Denmark </p>
<p>from Sweden. Catherine agreed to come to Copenhagen the next day and </p>
<p>to spend the subsequent night at a hotel there, so that we would not </p>
<p>have to terminate the festivities too soon. I have no more detailed </p>
<p>recollection of how we spent the day in Copenhagen; all this </p>
<p>forgetfulness speaks well for Catherine's impact upon my powers of </p>
<p>observation. I do recall a curious incident when Catherine returned </p>
<p>to the Terminus Hotel to change for dinner. While waiting in the </p>
<p>lobby, I decided that I should take advantage of the opportunity. </p>
<p>Finding a door marked "Herren", I passed through it and found myself </p>
<p>at the top of a flight of stairs that went down to a small landing </p>
<p>with only one door that said "Privat", and another flight of stairs </p>
<p>with a sign pointing downward and saying "Toilet". At the </p>
<p>subbasement level, the stairs ended at a door that clearly said, </p>
<p>"Personnen verbjuden ingang". After studying this for a while, I </p>
<p>opened the door and found a perfectly satisfactory lavatory. I still </p>
<p>wonder about this, from time to time.</p>
<p>A similar episode later in the evening also surprised although it </p>
<p>did not puzzle me. At this time we were in the Valentsia (phonetic </p>
<p>spelling) Nightclub. Catherine excused herself to go to the powder </p>
<p>room, which she later reported to be normal and neat. I, following </p>
<p>unambiguous signs for the men's room, found myself out in the alley </p>
<p>behind the establishment. (While writing these lines, I am </p>
<p>interested to notice that these episodes that I remember happened </p>
<p>when Catherine had left me for a few minutes. Perhaps she can </p>
<p>explain this).</p>
<p>But the pleasantest of functions must end. In the morning I saw </p>
<p>Catherine onto her train for Helsingor, nearly missing my own train </p>
<p>in the process, because I failed to leave her before the car doors </p>
<p>had been locked. Fortunately, there was a suburban station where I </p>
<p>found a fast taxi. I spent the rest of the day crossing Denmark to </p>
<p>Esbjerg, a port that exists primarily for shipping breakfast </p>
<p>materials to England. When I arrived, I found a small village and a </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Londonagain">London Again </a>83</p>
<p>fine concrete pier a hundred feet wide and nearly two hundred yards </p>
<p>long. On this was piled a mountain of eggs, butter, and bacon that </p>
<p>must have been fifty feet wide, twenty feet high, and as long as the </p>
<p>pier. After a while a thirty thousand ton ship pulled in alongside, </p>
<p>and the contents of the pier were transferred to the ship in a half. </p>
<p>hour or so. A modest number of passengers followed, and we were on </p>
<p>our way to Harwich. I found out on board that the pier was filled </p>
<p>and emptied twice a day, and that Esbjerg was only one of a half </p>
<p>dozen towns where the same thing was happening. It is no wonder that </p>
<p>British breakfasts are so good! </p>
<p>At Harwich I had great trouble with the customs inspector. During </p>
<p>the "comradely tea party" at Orenburg, each of the expedition </p>
<p>members had been presented an Orenburg shawl. These were famous </p>
<p>local products reputedly made from the fleece of young camels. If </p>
<p>they were not so soft and warm, I would think of them as lace. They </p>
<p>fitted the descriptions I had read in fairy tales as a youngster </p>
<p>because, although perhaps five feet by seven in size, they could </p>
<p>easily be drawn through a lady's ring. They were supposed to be rare </p>
<p>and valuable. I had taken this statement with a grain of salt before </p>
<p>reaching Harwich. There the customs inspector sprang upon my shawl </p>
<p>with a glad cry. He promptly demanded a deposit on the order of a </p>
<p>hundred pounds before he would let me take the shawl across England </p>
<p>on my transit visa. This was awkward, because I then had no money </p>
<p>even remotely resembling a hundred pounds. After a long discussion, </p>
<p>with many pleas of abject poverty and solemn promises to take the </p>
<p>shawl out of England again, the inspector finally decided to forget </p>
<p>the whole matter and let me go. When I got home, I felt it right to </p>
<p>present the Orenburg shawl to Professor Mimno's wife. Fortunately, </p>
<p>Catherine had one of her own (which she had transported across </p>
<p>borders by the simple expedient of wearing it) so that I still have </p>
<p>at least a small interest in one of these souvenirs.</p>
<p>I had two weeks to spend in England before my boat sailed, and very </p>
<p>little money left. I found two or three facilities that greatly </p>
<p>eased my problem. I located a little rooming-house near the British </p>
<p>Museum where I got my bed and an excellent (Danish?) breakfast for </p>
<p>two guineas a week. There was also a fine old hotel, the Thackeray, </p>
<p>nearly across the street from the Museum. One could walk into the </p>
<p>lounge in the afternoon, press a button and say "tea" to the </p>
<p>waitress, and receive a substantial meal for a shilling. With my </p>
<p>hearty breakfast taken late and a good tea, I required no other </p>
<p>meals during this period. I spent a great deal of time in the </p>
<p>British Museum, which then closely resembled grandmother's attic. In </p>
<p>more recent years they have relegated 95% of the collections to </p>
<p>storage and have displayed the best to excellent advantage. It is </p>
<p>now a far more attractive museum, but with not nearly so much to </p>
<p>look at. Occasionally, during this waiting period, I would treat </p>
<p>myself to underground fare to some other part of London to wander </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>London Again 84</p>
<p>for a while, but for most of this fortnight the Russell Square area </p>
<p>was my habitat.</p>
<p>On one memorable afternoon, Professor Appleton invited me to tea at </p>
<p>the Halley-Stewart Laboratories. I found, to my surprise, a group of </p>
<p>a dozen of the most eminent ionospheric researchers in England, </p>
<p>including Professor (later Sir Robert) Watson-Watt. Professor </p>
<p>Appleton promptly stood me up at a blackboard and they all began </p>
<p>asking questions about my views on various ionospheric problems, as </p>
<p>well as about the work in Russia. Possibly because I was the victim, </p>
<p>I found the interrogation rougher than any oral doctoral examination </p>
<p>I ever attended. The worst came when Professor Appleton, with a </p>
<p>malicious gleam in his eye, asked what I thought of the paper by </p>
<p>Watson-Watt and one of his students that announced the discovery of </p>
<p>a reasonably highly-reflecting "C layer" at a height of ten or </p>
<p>fifteen kilometers. I had to plead ignorance, for which I was </p>
<p>forgiven when it was recalled that the paper had been published just </p>
<p>as I went into Russia. Professor Appleton then gave me a one-minute </p>
<p>summary of Professor Watson-Watt's claims, and demanded an opinion. </p>
<p>It was fairly obvious that the reported reflections must have come </p>
<p>from hills or buildings or aircraft, or all three, but I dared not </p>
<p>suggest this simple explanation with Watson-Watt scowling at me. I </p>
<p>got out of my difficulty reasonably well explaining that many people </p>
<p>had measured coefficients of reflection of the higher layers that </p>
<p>would be impossible if the new lower layer really existed. The </p>
<p>afternoon ended without my having added much to the enmity that </p>
<p>existed between Appleton and Watson Watt. During and after World War </p>
<p>II, Sir Robert managed to acquire a reputation as "the father of </p>
<p>radar", which he claimed to have invented in 1934. I have often </p>
<p>wondered when the idea really came to him.</p>
<p>My ship was the "American Banker", one of the American Export Line's </p>
<p>one-class vessels. I had a pleasant crossing, except that I </p>
<p>hesitated to ask the staff for anything because I knew that my tips </p>
<p>would have to be far below standard. By being niggardly enough in </p>
<p>this respect, I succeeded in getting back to Cambridge with seventy-</p>
<p>five cents in my pocket.</p>

<b><p><a name="Phonography">Phonography</a></p>
</b><p>Throughout the four years that began immediately after my return </p>
<p>from Russia, I performed in at least a two-ring circus. The very-</p>
<p>high-frequency work having tapered off, I was more deeply engaged in </p>
<p>ionospheric problems, some of them being attempts to prove that </p>
<p>meteors contribute significant ionization in the upper atmosphere. I </p>
<p>was also drawn into a busy collaboration with Professor Hunt in </p>
<p>investigation of problems in sound reproduction from phonograph </p>
<p>records. </p>
<p>Professor Mimno insisted that I should complete the requirements for </p>
<p>my bachelors degree, and Harvard was more than generous in giving me </p>
<p>time and tuition grants for this purpose. I took Ted Hunt's </p>
<p>excellent course in acoustics and two or three cultural courses in </p>
<p>Summer School. Credit for these was transferred to Maine, which gave </p>
<p>me the B.A. in the fall of 1937. Passing this milestone brought up </p>
<p>the question of advanced degrees. It was financially impossible to </p>
<p>take full time for these, and it seemed grossly unfair to think of </p>
<p>stealing from my work as much time as would be needed. Under these </p>
<p>pressures, I decided that I must see what I could do at Harvard </p>
<p>without further degrees. I reasoned that if I could publish enough </p>
<p>scientific papers the University would find it difficult to explain </p>
<p>that I was just a minor technician and might appoint me to some kind </p>
<p>of staff status. I may say at once that this campaign worked well; </p>
<p>in 1939, after I had (with Professor Mimno, or Professor Hunt, or by </p>
<p>myself) published ten or twelve papers, the Corporation granted me a </p>
<p>minor annual appointment.</p>
<p>Before describing the phonographic work that took a third or more of </p>
<p>my time from 1936 to 1940, I must assign more credit to Professor </p>
<p>Mimno. I am sure that he was primarily responsible for finding, in </p>
<p>dusty corners of small budgets, enough funds to support my salary. I </p>
<p>surely felt that he had the right to direct my efforts, but he never </p>
<p>hinted at any dissatisfaction, even when my conscience nagged at me </p>
<p>for working as hard as I soon did in a field in which he bad no </p>
<p>special interest. It is, I suppose, true that I was generally </p>
<p>working at least ten or twelve hours each day in this era, as I had </p>
<p>little money or interest for other things, but my admiration and </p>
<p>gratitude for Harry's tolerance remain among my best remembered </p>
<p>emotions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>In August, 1936, then, I found Ted Hunt, with whom I was only </p>
<p>casually acquainted, overloaded in his efforts to finish building </p>
<p>some remarkably-advanced equipment for making phonograph records of </p>
<p>the proceedings of the Harvard Tercentenary Celebration. Ted had </p>
<p>induced the Tercentenary authorities to give him the financial help </p>
<p>needed for his desired instruments by suggesting the importance of </p>
<p>preserving for the fourth centenary celebration a complete audible </p>
<p>record of the activities at the third. While the idea of making such </p>
<p>records was exciting, I suspect that Ted's greatest interest was in </p>
<p>procuring equipment that he could use later for research purposes. </p>
<p>He had bought professional-quality turntables and other record-</p>
<p>cutting gear and had had high quality telephone lines run through </p>
<p>the steam tunnels to connect the important buildings with the </p>
<p>proposed recording room in the Research Laboratory of Physics. Being </p>
<p>dissatisfied with any recording amplifiers he could buy, he was </p>
<p>building his own to very advanced standards; it was in completing </p>
<p>the construction of these that he was falling seriously behind </p>
<p>schedule. It was to be expected that there would also be an </p>
<p>uncertain, but large, amount of testing and experimental record </p>
<p>cutting to be done.</p>
<p>The Harvard Tercentenary was by far the greatest academic </p>
<p>celebration in my experience, or perhaps in my lifetime. After two </p>
<p>or three weeks of Conferences on Arts and Sciences, the formal </p>
<p>proceedings lasted three days. It was like a glorified Commencement. </p>
<p>The whole Harvard Yard was decorated, among other things, by </p>
<p>hundreds of white poles carrying at their tops gilded Cambridge </p>
<p>lions. Sixty-two honorary degrees were awarded. Delegates from about </p>
<p>five hundred universities and colleges and fifty learned societies </p>
<p>marched in the academic procession in order of the ages of the </p>
<p>institutions, beginning with Al-Azhar which was founded in the year </p>
<p>970 A.D. The President of the United States was allowed a part in </p>
<p>the festival; John Masefield, the Poet Laureate of England, read a </p>
<p>poem; and musical portions were performed by the Boston Symphony </p>
<p>Orchestra. Seats were provided for 15,000 guests in the quadrangle </p>
<p>between the Memorial Church and the Widener Library. This </p>
<p>Tercentenary Theater was served by a remarkable sound system </p>
<p>contrived and supplied by the Bell Telephone Laboratories and the </p>
<p>Western Electric Company, allegedly at a cost of over $100,000. The </p>
<p>Theater has been used for Commencements since 1936, and the sound </p>
<p>reinforcement system has come down through the years surprisingly </p>
<p>won, with only occasional modifications and replacements of </p>
<p>equipment. The sound system for the Tercentenary was so free of </p>
<p>distortion and so artfully supplied from loudspeakers in the trees </p>
<p>and on surrounding buildings that most members of the audience did </p>
<p>not realize that electronic assistance was providing what they </p>
<p>heard. It was commonplace to hear people ask each other, "Why don't </p>
<p>they have a public address system?", not realizing that without one </p>
<p>they could have heard almost nothing from the rostrum at their </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phonography 87</p>
<p>distant seats.</p>
<p>With such a tempting program to be recorded, it is not surprising </p>
<p>that I volunteered and worked very hard with Ted to help complete </p>
<p>his equipment and learn how a recording was made. We slaved day and </p>
<p>night and, in classical fashion, completed the last changes and </p>
<p>adjustments within the hour before the ceremonies began. From my </p>
<p>point of view this rush had one bad effect. Ted claimed that I was </p>
<p>the only one who could be trusted with the actual cutting of the </p>
<p>records. I therefore spent the entire Tercentenary perched on a high </p>
<p>stool in front of the recording turntables and saw nothing of the </p>
<p>pageantry, although I must admit that I heard everything remarkably </p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>In the weeks following the Tercentenary, we cut more test records </p>
<p>and learned to make optical studies of the record grooves, </p>
<p>microscopically and in other ways. We discovered that we had, </p>
<p>perhaps largely by accident, made records of what was then </p>
<p>phenomenally high quality. This knowledge placed us in an </p>
<p>intolerable position because there was no phonograph pickup in </p>
<p>existence that could reproduce what we had recorded. Even worse, </p>
<p>there was no pickup that could be used without damaging the records. </p>
<p>We had had an instinctive realization of this tact, and had not </p>
<p>allowed any of the Tercentenary records to be played back, with the </p>
<p>exception of a few short sections at points where President Conant </p>
<p>insisted on finding out exactly what expressions had been used, or </p>
<p>where he wished to know whether certain off-microphone remarks had </p>
<p>been picked up and recorded, as they usually had been.</p>
<p>Knowing the excellent quality of today's phonographs and records, it </p>
<p>is hard to realize how bad nearly all of them were in 1936. In the </p>
<p>preceding decade, the old mechanical reproducers had been replaced </p>
<p>by electric pickups, amplifiers, and loudspeakers. The pickups and </p>
<p>the amplifiers, at least, followed the old designs because they were </p>
<p>intended to play the same records, which were, not to conceal the </p>
<p>truth, awful. To get enough acoustical power from the record groove </p>
<p>through a mechanical pickup, the stylus had to be pressed hard </p>
<p>against the record. In ordinary practice,the unbalanced weight of a </p>
<p>pickup was as nuch as four ounces. This weight rested on a needle </p>
<p>whose point had dimensions or only a few thousandths of an inch. The </p>
<p>resulting pressure was in the range of 20,000 to 50,000 pounds per </p>
<p>square inch, which exceeded the elastic limit of the record </p>
<p>material. The sharp point Of the usual steel needle would gouge out </p>
<p>the groove, erasing the higher recorded frequency components and </p>
<p>tearing the surfaces of the record groove so that random (scratch) </p>
<p>noise increased each time the record was played. Teddy's favorite </p>
<p>simile was to suggest that the effect was like dragging a cannon </p>
<p>ball along the furrow in a plowed field. To decrease the tearing </p>
<p>effect, abrasives were added to the record material so that a new </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Quality">The Quality of Phonographs in 1936</b> </a>88</p>
<p>needle would be ground to fit the groove after a few revolutions of </p>
<p>the turntable. This distributed the weight over a larger area of </p>
<p>contact so that the tearing was reduced, but it had two serious </p>
<p>disadvantages. The larger area of contact meant that the highest </p>
<p>frequencies could not be reproduced; while the roughness of the </p>
<p>abrasive produced unnatural, and unwanted, noise. It was therefore </p>
<p>common practice to limit the high-frequency response of the </p>
<p>reproducing system to about 3500 cycles per second, or little more </p>
<p>than the frequency range of an ordinary telephone circuit. The only </p>
<p>exception to this unfortunate situation was in the ease of </p>
<p>transcription records made for distribution of radio broadcasts. </p>
<p>These had recently been greatly improved by the Bell Telephone </p>
<p>Laboratories and the Western Electric organization. The </p>
<p>transcription records were in vertical cut on sixteen-inch lacquer-</p>
<p>coated discs that would play for almost thirty minutes. In </p>
<p>retrospect, it is clear that their virtues were the results of a new </p>
<p>order of care used in their manufacture.</p>
<p>Our records were cut in vinylite, without abrasive, so that they </p>
<p>exhibited even less noise than the transcription records. Because </p>
<p>this plastic was softer than the commercial shellac records, ours </p>
<p>were even more subject to tearing of the grooves and wearing off of </p>
<p>the high-frequency components of the sound. The obvious direction to </p>
<p>take in making a suitable pickup was to reduce the pressure on the </p>
<p>record to the point where all stresses were below the elastic limit </p>
<p>of the record material. This would mean that the entire mechanism </p>
<p>would have to be very light. It was clear that the power available </p>
<p>from a pickup would be proportional to the mass of material vibrated </p>
<p>by the modulation of the record grooves; making the pickup light </p>
<p>would reduce the power output. This fact did not disturb us, as good </p>
<p>amplifiers, were easy to make. We felt that even if the output </p>
<p>should be as low as that from a microphone we would still have a </p>
<p>useful device.</p>
<p>We began our experimenting with a simple hairpin of thin phosphor-</p>
<p>bronze ribbon. At the front, or closed end, of the hairpin the </p>
<p>ribbon's breadth was perpendicular to the record. This loop was </p>
<p>coupled to a sapphire stylus by a very light aluminum cone. Lateral </p>
<p>vibration of the stylus thus produced a rotary motion of the hairpin </p>
<p>in a magnetic field produced by a permanent magnet, so that the </p>
<p>front part of the hairpin was a single-turn coil and formed a small </p>
<p>alternating-current generator. The rotation of the hairpin was made </p>
<p>easier by twisting the ribbon in the rear part outside of the </p>
<p>magnetic field into the horizontal plane. A defect of this device </p>
<p>was that the front center of the hairpin had to be supported by a </p>
<p>block of viscous damping material to maintain the right pressure on </p>
<p>the record, and the acoustical characteristics depended in part on </p>
<p>the size and shape of the block of damping material. The pickup did, </p>
<p>however, show great promise. One inconvenience was that the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Pickup">Pickup Design</b> </a>89</p>
<p>impedance of the generator was very small, about 0.005 ohm, so that </p>
<p>heavy wires had to be used if the output were to be conducted very </p>
<p>far. We solved this problem by having a small transformer that </p>
<p>brought the impedance up to 500 ohms, and used the transformer </p>
<p>itself as a counterweight at the far end of the tone arm on which </p>
<p>the pickup was mounted.</p>
<p>We worked our way through many variations of this device. Each time </p>
<p>we made a major change in the design we increased the model number, </p>
<p>while minor variations were accounted for by letters, in </p>
<p>alphabetical sequence, appended to the number. By the time we </p>
<p>graduated from model HP-5G to HP-6A, we felt that we had a pickup </p>
<p>worth demonstrating and whose characteristics were worth publishing. </p>
<p>The hairpin had now become a little tube of phosphor-bronze about </p>
<p>three one-hundredths of an inch in diameter with walls two one </p>
<p>thousandths of an inch thick. The needed flexibility toward the </p>
<p>rear, where the hairpin was fixed, was provided by simply crushing </p>
<p>the tube into flat strips. This construction gave us good rigidity </p>
<p>in the coil part where it was needed, and flexibility where that was </p>
<p>essential. The electrical performance was sensational, for those </p>
<p>days, extending from 30 to 10,000 cycles per second. The power </p>
<p>output was admittedly very low, about one one-thousandth part of </p>
<p>normal, but this did not constitute a serious problem.</p>
<p>One of the most fascinating features was the light weight on the </p>
<p>record; about two grams. This produced pressures so gentle that it </p>
<p>was impossible to damage a record. We would astonish guests and </p>
<p>audiences by dropping the pickup two or three inches onto a fresh </p>
<p>uncut record. This would produce no visible or audible dent. An even </p>
<p>more startling test was to place a finger on each side of the tone </p>
<p>arm and scrub it back and forth across the grooves while a record </p>
<p>was being played. With any other pickup this would instantly ruin </p>
<p>the record. With ours, the noise from the loudspeaker during the </p>
<p>scrubbing was, of course, intolerable, but afterward the record </p>
<p>continued to play with no sign of damage. These characteristics and </p>
<p>the tonal quality of the reproduction were quite unheard of, and we </p>
<p>demonstrated them to any audience we could muster. Most experts </p>
<p>found it hard to believe that our audiences consistently voted Not' </p>
<p>when we inserted electrical filters and cut off the response to </p>
<p>frequencies above 11,000 cycles per second. Such a result was </p>
<p>contrary to the assumption that people did not want high frequency </p>
<p>response. We had proved that, if distortion and noise were </p>
<p>sufficiently reduced, the public really did like good sound </p>
<p>reproduction.</p>
<p>We had reached this state in November, 1937, and reported our </p>
<p>results first at the Acoustical Society meeting in Ann Arbor, </p>
<p>Michigan. This was an especially welcome opportunity for me, as </p>
<p>Catherine had left Vassar to pursue her graduate studies at the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Benner">Mr. Benner's Precise Machine Work</a></b> 90</p>
<p>University of Michigan. I thus had a fine chance to visit her while </p>
<p>helping to amaze the acoustical experts of the country. Our paper on </p>
<p>HP6A was published in early 1938 and drew about two hundred fan </p>
<p>letters, a remarkable response for a scientific paper. Some of these </p>
<p>correspondents kept us writing letters for years; in fact, I think </p>
<p>the file was not closed until 1946.</p>
<p>We continued to improve our pickups until 1940; I think the last was </p>
<p>HP-23. We finally learned how to make them without any damping </p>
<p>material, which in reality had been needed only to control unwanted </p>
<p>modes of vibration. Although Teddy and I no doubt had the ideas </p>
<p>about what we wanted, most of the credit for these remarkably light </p>
<p>pickups must go to Harold Benner. Mr. Benner was the elderly chief </p>
<p>machinist at Cruft Laboratory. So far as I know, he could make </p>
<p>anything. I remember one occasion when one of the rich young men </p>
<p>around the lab had bought his wife a tiny Swiss watch. The works </p>
<p>were so small that if one had had two of them they could have been </p>
<p>placed side by aide on a dime without overhanging the edge. One of </p>
<p>the watch jewels had become broken, and a number of major jewelers </p>
<p>had refused to undertake repairs. When appropriately challenged, Mr. </p>
<p>Benner took the job home, where he had a more delicate jewelers </p>
<p>lathe than he had at the lab, and ground and drilled a new jewel </p>
<p>with satisfactory results.</p>
<p>The challenge was an important part of getting the best from Hr. </p>
<p>Benner. We learned to approach a delicate job by saying, "We don't </p>
<p>believe it can be done, but what we really need is . . ." An </p>
<p>excellent example is the kind of cone we used in our later pickups. </p>
<p>These were about two tenths of an inch long and one tenth in </p>
<p>diameter. At the top was a narrow cylindrical section to which a </p>
<p>thin silver band was later cemented, and there was a little button </p>
<p>at the end into which a sapphire or diamond stylus point was </p>
<p>inserted. Mr. Benner would start with a rod of duralumin. After </p>
<p>boring a cylindrical and then conical hole in the end, he would </p>
<p>cement this end to a correspondingly tapered arbor so the he could </p>
<p>reverse the rod in his lathe. He would then turn down the outside of </p>
<p>the cone until the remaining structure had a thickness of half a </p>
<p>thousandth of an inch, except at the little bump at the end. The </p>
<p>completed cones weighed an average of about four milligrams; it </p>
<p>would have taken 7,000 of them to weigh an ounce. I must admit that </p>
<p>occasionally one of these cones would be torn during the final </p>
<p>cutting but, even so, this remains one of the most remarkable </p>
<p>examples of fine machining that I ever watched. Certainly, without </p>
<p>Mr. Benner we could have done nothing important.</p>
<p>People never realize the combination of flexibility and internal </p>
<p>stiffness required in a phonograph reproducer. The acceleration in a </p>
<p>record groove can easily reach a thousand times the acceleration due </p>
<p>to gravity. If an automobile could tolerate such acceleration, it </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Distortion">Studies of Distortion</b> </a>91</p>
<p>would reach a speed of fifty miles an hour after the first inch of </p>
<p>travel. For a pickup to withstand such forces, the effective mass </p>
<p>referred to the stylus tip must be a thousand times smaller than the </p>
<p>unbalanced weight on the record. For use with lateral cut records, </p>
<p>much of the mass of our pickups was concentrated relatively near to </p>
<p>the axis of rotation. We could then have a total mass perhaps as </p>
<p>large as ten milligrams and yet achieve a playing weight of only two </p>
<p>grams, or about one fifteenth of an ounce.</p>
<p>Our best proof of the value of light weight on the record was a </p>
<p>commercial Beethoven recording that we played over 2500 times in </p>
<p>tests and demonstrations of various pickups. After all of this use, </p>
<p>it still had the "gleam" of a new one. We used to annoy Briggs and </p>
<p>Briggs, the fine music store in Harvard Square, when we went to </p>
<p>choose a new test record. After listening to many, in an effort to </p>
<p>select passages that were hard to reproduce accurately, we would say </p>
<p>to the clerk, "This one is good; now go get us a new record that has </p>
<p>not been played". One of our finest and most difficult tests was the </p>
<p>"singing strings" passage in the third movement of Brahms' first </p>
<p>symphony. Any pickup that could reproduce these measures without </p>
<p>audible distortion was clearly of the first rank.</p>
<p>Consideration of the pickup behavior led us into a long study of the </p>
<p>geometrical relations between the stylus tip and the record groove. </p>
<p>The details of this research are too complex to be worth discussing </p>
<p>here. The important point is that we have to out a groove with a </p>
<p>very sharp-edged tool although we must play it back with a smooth </p>
<p>(spherical or ellipsoidal) stylus tip. For this reason, the motion </p>
<p>of a playback stylus is not the same as the motion of the cutting </p>
<p>tool with which the record was made. We realized that the center of </p>
<p>a spherical stylus traced a curve that remained at a constant </p>
<p>distance from each of the surfaces of a record groove, If, for </p>
<p>purposes of analysis, we took each wall of the groove as following a </p>
<p>sine wave, the stylus would move along a path that was completely </p>
<p>determined by the amplitude and wavelength of the sine wave and the </p>
<p>radius of the stylus. A defined curve of this sort seemed to deserve </p>
<p>a name. We originally called it the "Pierceoid", partly because I </p>
<p>first suggested the existence of such a family of relationships, but </p>
<p>chiefly because I made the extremely tedious calculations required </p>
<p>to determine the amount of distortion produced in this way. This </p>
<p>name seemed unduly awkward, however, and we shortened it to the </p>
<p>"Poid" before we used the term in print. I am still occasionally </p>
<p>pleased to find that this name is defined in a technical dictionary.</p>
<p>Ted and I came to the interesting conclusion that, in the matter of </p>
<p>distortion, lateral-cut records had a distinct advantage over those </p>
<p>that were made with vertical motion of the cutting stylus. Knowing, </p>
<p>by now, the physical requirements (the right amount of stiffness, </p>
<p>the small mass, and the capability to withstand high acceleration) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Useless">Useless Patents</b> </a>92</p>
<p>for a good pickup, we were able to define the criteria for a </p>
<p>satisfactory reproducer and to establish the kind of groove that </p>
<p>might be used to make long-playing records. Because we could not </p>
<p>conceive of a cutting head that could simultaneously record both </p>
<p>vertically and laterally, we failed explicitly to predict stereo </p>
<p>disc recording. The paper we wrote about these matters was the most </p>
<p>important one in our collaboration. It was simultaneously published </p>
<p>in the Journals of the Acoustical Society and the Society of Motion </p>
<p>Picture Engineers; a somewhat rare happening that was possible </p>
<p>because both editors wanted the paper and did not feel that their </p>
<p>membership lists overlapped too much.</p>
<p>We gave the subject matter of this paper verbally at several </p>
<p>meetings of scientific societies. This became something of a road </p>
<p>show; wherever we went the Bell Telephone Laboratories sent two or </p>
<p>three of their engineers to try to refute our claims about the </p>
<p>superiority of lateral recording. This was a great deal of fun </p>
<p>because by the time of each meeting the opposition had thought up </p>
<p>new arguments in favor of their excellent vertical records. As their </p>
<p>new ideas were always presented in discussion periods after we had </p>
<p>made our exposition, we had to think fast to find satisfactory </p>
<p>counter arguments extemporaneously. Perhaps the most interesting </p>
<p>proof of the soundness of our work did not come until eighteen years </p>
<p>later, in 1966, when the Audio Engineering Society decided to make </p>
<p>me an honorary member. This surprised me, as I had had no connection </p>
<p>with audio engineering for fully fifteen years. I could not resist </p>
<p>going to the convention in New York to be awarded this honor. It </p>
<p>turned out that when the industry was getting ready to produce </p>
<p>stereo records, people had found the mathematical basis they needed </p>
<p>in the 1938 Pierce and Hunt paper. I was very lucky in this in </p>
<p>stance. Ted and I had a policy of alternately assuming the position </p>
<p>of senior author and this most important of our papers fell into my </p>
<p>share.</p>
<p>In the course of this work, Ted and I had secured two patents that </p>
<p>seemed to be very sound. They were fundamental, as we claimed the </p>
<p>physical features that would cover any phonograph pickup that could </p>
<p>trace a groove in accordance with our teachings; and these teachings </p>
<p>defined the criteria for satisfactory freedom from distortion and </p>
<p>record damage. We thought that these patents were valuable </p>
<p>properties, but most of the industry correctly judged that we were </p>
<p>academic types who would never know how to fight a patent suit. An </p>
<p>exception to this general policy was nearly provided by Columbia </p>
<p>Records, which got far enough to offer us each $3000 a year, for the </p>
<p>life of our patents, for the rights. I tried hard to get Ted to </p>
<p>accept this offer but, at the time, he had an inflated idea of the </p>
<p>value of a patent. It had happened that, some years before, Ted had </p>
<p>invented the electronic frequency meter. His friends at the General </p>
<p>Radio Company were interested in manufacturing it, and offered him </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="GW">G.W.'s Advice / Psychology of Hearing</b> </a>93</p>
<p>his choice of two deals: $1,000 outright, or a five percent royalty </p>
<p>on whatever they sold. It did not seem that the sales would be </p>
<p>large, and Ted had chosen the royalty chiefly out of friendship, not </p>
<p>wanting the company to pay too much in case the frequency meter </p>
<p>should not be a commercial success. Over several years, his receipts </p>
<p>were showing some signs of reaching the thousand dollar level. By </p>
<p>the time our phonograph patents were issued, World War II was </p>
<p>beginning, and the U.S. Navy decided to put one of Ted's frequency </p>
<p>meters in nearly every ship and shore installation. When the </p>
<p>Columbia patent deal was being negotiated, Ted was collecting </p>
<p>thousands from the frequency meter. This led him to feel that </p>
<p>Columbia would pay more, but his stubborn attitude outlasted </p>
<p>Columbia's patience. The deal collapsed, partly because Ted and I </p>
<p>were both deeply involved in war work and had little time or </p>
<p>interest for anything else. As a result, we never collected a penny </p>
<p>on our patents. It has always interested me that Columbia's Peter </p>
<p>Goldmark, after the war, emerged as the inventor of long playing </p>
<p>records. Dr. Goldmark did a magnificent job of development, reducing </p>
<p>our ideas to practice. I was to learn that this is usually a harder </p>
<p>and more critical part of bringing a new device before the public </p>
<p>than is the invention of the idea but, for a time, I sorely missed </p>
<p>having a share of the credit. I did not then know President A. </p>
<p>Lawrence Lowell's frequently repeated aphorism, "You may get results </p>
<p>or you may get credit for results; you can rarely have both."</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>In the early days of these patents, Teddy and I had felt that we did </p>
<p>not know how to make them show the most (if any) profit. As </p>
<p>Professor G. W. Pierce was known to hold many patents and to have an </p>
<p>aggressive patent attorney, we approached him for advice, saying, in </p>
<p>effect, "How do you decide what royalty to charge for the use of a </p>
<p>patent". After a moment of thought, G.W. explained that the trick </p>
<p>was to establish a rate such that the product of the rate and the </p>
<p>number of items sold would become a maximum. "Yes, yes!" said Teddy </p>
<p>and I eagerly, And how do you do that? Why, said G.W., flothing </p>
<p>could be more simple. One simply expresses the function, </p>
<p>differentiates it, and sets the result equal to zero. With this </p>
<p>profound advice ringing in our ears, Teddy and I retired to our own </p>
<p>quarters as least as wise as when we had come in.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>It is hard to say whether it is good or bad that the human ear (or </p>
<p>more probably brain) easily adapts to what it is hearing. If one's </p>
<p>record player or radio is a little out of its best adjustment, this </p>
<p>fact must be noted and the error be corrected within seconds after </p>
<p>the machine has been turned on. If the fault be not readjusted </p>
<p>immediately, the ear will become used to it and the sound will come </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>G.W.'s Advice / Psychology of Hearing 94</p>
<p>to seem natural. The bigger the defect the longer it will take to </p>
<p>get used to it, but ultimately the ear will like the sounds it is </p>
<p>familiar with. There is a classical story about one of the most </p>
<p>famous audio engineers who, many years ago, bought a fine radio with </p>
<p>far better frequency response than the one he had had. The radio was </p>
<p>unquestionably superior, but his wife detested it because it </p>
<p>shrieked at her. Being a practical psychologist as well as a married </p>
<p>man, the engineer said he would fix it. He concealed in the cabinet. </p>
<p>fifty of the old two microfarad paper capacitors that every lab used </p>
<p>to have many of and connected them in parallel across the voice coil </p>
<p>of the loudspeaker. This reduced the quality of the sound to about </p>
<p>the level of the old radio and satisfied the wife. Then, every </p>
<p>Sunday morning before his wife appeared, he would reach behind the </p>
<p>speaker enclosure with his cutting pliers and disconnect one or more </p>
<p>of the capacitors. In a few months he brought the tone quality back </p>
<p>to what it should have been, and his wife still thought it was </p>
<p>wonderful.</p>
<p>When working in sound reproduction, one needs to be continuously on </p>
<p>guard lest, instead of continuing to make improvements, he come to </p>
<p>like what he has. It is too easy to improve things so that they be </p>
<p>come more like what he enjoyed last week or last month. This is, of </p>
<p>course, negative progress. Fortunately, Ted and I were able to adopt </p>
<p>a happy plan that probably had a great deal to do with the ultimate </p>
<p>quality of our work. It happened that the Hunts had season tickets </p>
<p>to the concerts of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and that Kay, Ted's </p>
<p>talented and long-suffering wife, had entered a period when she was </p>
<p>caring for a small son and did not seem to care greatly whether she </p>
<p>went to the concerts or not. She effectively deeded her seat to me </p>
<p>so that, after working all week to the point where we began to be </p>
<p>satisfied with the music we were getting from our fine machinery, </p>
<p>Ted and I could go to the Saturday night concert and get our musical </p>
<p>taste recalibrated. By thus keeping the absolute standard of musical </p>
<p>excellence in the forepart of our attention, we were able to prevent </p>
<p>ourselves from becoming self-hypnotized and too satisfied with the </p>
<p>results of our labors.</p>
<p>The phonograph pickup is not the only important part of the re </p>
<p>producing system. Amplifiers and loudspeakers were subjected to </p>
<p>careful study, but we made no inventions in these areas. Ted </p>
<p>designed and the lab's best carpenter, Billy Kennealy, built for us </p>
<p>an excellent low-frequency speaker. This came in two halves, each </p>
<p>about three feet by six and five feet high, or as large as could </p>
<p>conveniently be wheeled through the various doors in the </p>
<p>laboratories. Each half consisted of a folded exponential horn which </p>
<p>was driven by a fifteen inch speaker. The high frequencies were </p>
<p>reproduced through a Fletcher horn, a multicellular speaker made by </p>
<p>the Western Electric Company for theater systems. The low-frequency </p>
<p>speakers were of complex construction inside, and it took us some </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Loudspeaker">Loudspeaker phasing</b> </a>95</p>
<p>weeks to add the necessary reinforcements in various places to </p>
<p>subdue unwanted resonances. During this interval, Frederick Saunders </p>
<p>wandered into the room. Professor Saunders was the chairman of the </p>
<p>Physics Department and an excellent violinist. He was blessed with </p>
<p>the rare talent of having absolute pitch and, being a good </p>
<p>physicist, he had taught himself to express this in either musical </p>
<p>or physical terms. After listening to the musical sounds our speaker </p>
<p>produced for a minute or two, he remarked, Your trouble is at 82 </p>
<p>cycles per second. When we located the unwanted vibration in the </p>
<p>box, we measured the frequency carefully. It was at exactly 82-1/2 </p>
<p>cycles.</p>
<p>It used to be dogma that "the ear takes no account of phase". This </p>
<p>statement is nearly true, but there are a few ears that are </p>
<p>especially sensitive. Two pairs of these belonged to Joe Maxfield </p>
<p>and Art College, the two stalwarts of E.R.P.I., the Western Electric </p>
<p>subsidiary that installed and maintained sound systems for movie </p>
<p>theaters. We had met Joe and Art in connection with the Tercentenary </p>
<p>and they kept an interested eye on what we were doing for several </p>
<p>years. When we set up our fine loudspeaker combination, they </p>
<p>complained that the phasing was not right. The high and low </p>
<p>frequency speakers crossed over (or radiated equal amounts of power) </p>
<p>at about 300 cycles per second. Because the component speakers were </p>
<p>effectively at different distances from the ears of the listener, </p>
<p>the 300 cycle sounds apparently arrived in different phases and </p>
<p>interfered in an unpleasant way, although Ted and I could hear </p>
<p>nothing wrong. Joe and Art assured us that it was only necessary to </p>
<p>change the high frequency speaker's position, on top of the low </p>
<p>frequency woofers, by a few inches to correct the trouble. We </p>
<p>decided to test this suggestion. Sending one of our visitors out of </p>
<p>the room, we let the other move the Fletcher horn, while listening </p>
<p>to good music, until he was satisfied. We then made a private mark </p>
<p>to record the position and threw the adjustment out. The other </p>
<p>expert then went through the same performance and amazed Ted and me </p>
<p>by settling on a position within about an eighth of an inch of that </p>
<p>selected by his colleague. Although we could hear nothing changing </p>
<p>as they made their adjustments, Ted and I had to admit that they </p>
<p>were hearing something real. After some months, I managed to train </p>
<p>my ears to detect a little of what Joe and Art had complained of; a </p>
<p>sort of "burr" when the music involved a tone at the crossover </p>
<p>frequency or near it, but I never attained much of their critical </p>
<p>ability.</p>
<p>Beginning as soon as we had suitable reproducing equipment, I became </p>
<p>involved in various minor recording activities, some of which had </p>
<p>entertaining aspects. In one of the early cases, the recording </p>
<p>served only as an introduction to the finest jam session I ever </p>
<p>attended. During the 1937 Summer School, I became acquainted with </p>
<p>several jazz aficionados, one of whom was a professor of history at </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Jam">Jam Session / Jim</b> </a>96</p>
<p>Columbia University. These friends were interested in several black </p>
<p>jazz musicians in Boston, whose talents they wished to advertise in </p>
<p>hope of getting them better engagements.</p>
<p>To advance this aim, I arranged an opportunity for the group to play </p>
<p>in the Music Building at Harvard, from which we had recording lines, </p>
<p>and made two or three records that my friends could use for </p>
<p>demonstration. This led to a happy Sunday when, soon after lunch, </p>
<p>five of us went to the hall of the negro musicians' union on </p>
<p>Columbus avenue. Each of us brought two one-gallon jugs of the </p>
<p>cheapest gin, and from then on we let nature take its course. Word </p>
<p>spread rapidly, and musicians and listeners arrived in great </p>
<p>numbers. I was astonished by the virtuosity of the players. When a </p>
<p>new man arrived he might take over the piano while the former </p>
<p>pianist would change to a trumpet or perhaps clarinet. The makeup of </p>
<p>the band changed in some such way every few minutes. The group could </p>
<p>play anything we asked for, but our ideas were soon exhausted and we </p>
<p>found it better to just sit back and listen. As the afternoon wore </p>
<p>on, followed by evening and night, it developed that the professor </p>
<p>had the fiscal resources to keep sending emissaries for huge trays </p>
<p>of sandwiches all the while, in some way. I did not understand (in </p>
<p>Boston, on Sunday), we were able to keep the gin flowing, at a </p>
<p>price. I have seldom heard jazz so well and spontaneously played, </p>
<p>even in the old days in Greenwich Village, and certainly was never </p>
<p>deluged by so much of it. I regretted that I had to leave at the </p>
<p>height of the party at about three A.M, and I was even more sorry </p>
<p>that the pressure of other things prevented me from keeping an </p>
<p>acquaintance with these remarkable musicians.</p>
<p>My fondness for Jim was of an entirely different kind. Jim was a </p>
<p>katydid coflected (by Dick Dow, who had been a friend of Catherine </p>
<p>since her college days) for Professor G.W. Pierce, in the early days </p>
<p>of his experimentation with the ultrasonic sounds of insects. G.W. </p>
<p>later wrote a charming book, called The Songs of Insects, that I </p>
<p>have always suspected of being the last book to be written in the </p>
<p>scientific style of the nineteenth century. The techniques for his </p>
<p>studies were a curious mixture of the new and the obsolescent. His </p>
<p>ways of picking up the sounds inaudible to the human ear were highly </p>
<p>modern, or even unique, but his methods for recording and analyzing </p>
<p>them would have been recognized by John Tyndall.</p>
<p>Most Insects had such low stridulation frequencies that they could </p>
<p>be recorded by G.W.'s crude equipment, but Jim modulated his high </p>
<p>frequencies so rapidly that the gear did not respond satisfactorily. </p>
<p>I earned myself a footnote in G.W.'s book by recording Jim's sounds </p>
<p>at 78 RPM and playing them back at 33 1/3 RPM, which brought them </p>
<p>into the range necessary for analysis.</p>
<p>Jim had a loud double chirp that was steadily repeated at night, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Hampden">Jim / Walter Hampden</b> </a>97</p>
<p>often for hours at a time. He was a favorite in the lab, where he </p>
<p>lived for several months while Paul Donaldson, the lab photographer, </p>
<p>took beautiful still pictures of him and tried hard to get high </p>
<p>speed movies that would reveal his stridulation technique. On one </p>
<p>occasion, G.W. arranged a radio broadcast about his insect noises </p>
<p>and I was drafted to run his sound effects. He wanted to use Jim as </p>
<p>an example, which worried me as the insect would often fall silent </p>
<p>without warning. By way of insurance, I kept a good record of Jim's </p>
<p>calls on a turntable, while I put Jim himself into a dark broom </p>
<p>closet with his own microphone. During the first part of G.W.'s talk </p>
<p>I spent most of my time monitoring him and running his other </p>
<p>exhibits, but kept nervously checking Jim's line to see if he was </p>
<p>still beeping. Fortunately, the katydid was highly reliable that day </p>
<p>and came through in excellent voice when called upon.</p>
<p>To change from silly to sublime subject matter, I must confess how </p>
<p>it happened that the world has no phonograph records of the </p>
<p>magnificent voice of Walter Hampden. A professor of public speaking </p>
<p>at Harvard, Freddy Packard, used phonograph records of his own in </p>
<p>his teaching, and he was fascinated by the quality of our records. </p>
<p>From time to time he would bring actors, who were playing in Boston, </p>
<p>over to Harvard and induce them to make a few private records that </p>
<p>he could use in his courses. Ted had, by this time, run microphone </p>
<p>and loudspeaker lines between our recording room and the Faculty </p>
<p>Room of the Physics Department. This was a pleasant, booklined room, </p>
<p>furnished as a living room, and we had determined that it had the </p>
<p>right acoustical properties to make it an excellent studio.</p>
<p>Walter Hampden was a famous Shakespearian actor. He could whisper or </p>
<p>shout or bellow with the most perfect clarity, and his range from </p>
<p>soft to loud was, we found, nearly equal to that of an orchestra. He </p>
<p>was quite correct in believing that no phonograph could do justice </p>
<p>to his voice, and he had never permitted a record to be made. In </p>
<p>some way Professor Packard overcame this reluctance and brought Mr. </p>
<p>Hampden to the Faculty Room. After a few minutes of talk, I went </p>
<p>upstairs to the recording room and warmed up the equipment while </p>
<p>suggestions for Mr. Hampden's readings were being discussed. Just as </p>
<p>I was ready for the performance to begin, the conversation in the </p>
<p>Faculty Room disclosed the fact that we had, the week before, made </p>
<p>records of Ethel Barrymore. Mr. Hampden insisted that he must hear </p>
<p>these before he would give his own readings. Accordingly, I quickly </p>
<p>undid my connections and put the Barrymore records on the </p>
<p>turntables. After playing these through the loudspeaker in the </p>
<p>Faculty Room, I reestablished the recording setup, and Mr. Hampden </p>
<p>began to recite. It was unfortunate that I happened to be monitoring </p>
<p>what went onto the records with a pair of crystal headphones. These </p>
<p>cheap devices had excellent high-frequency response but were very </p>
<p>deficient in the low frequencies. As a result I, being busy trying </p>
<p>to keep Mr. Hampden's glorious words from overloading or </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Walter Hampden 98</p>
<p>undercutting the records, did not notice anything wrong with the </p>
<p>tonal quality of the sound until the time came for playing back the </p>
<p>records we had made. They sounded as one might imagine they would if </p>
<p>mouthed by a hippopotamus. By the time I discovered that, in my </p>
<p>haste to re-establish recording conditions, I had plugged the in </p>
<p>Faculty Room monitor speaker where the microphone ought to have </p>
<p>been, Mr. Hampden had departed in his very highest dudgeon. I was </p>
<p>never able to learn that he ventured into a recording studio again.</p>

</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "radio" side of my life between 1936 and 1940 was fully as </p>
<p>fascinating as the phonographic work, but it was of far less general </p>
<p>interest and only indirectly of much importance. With one exception, </p>
<p>to be described below, the meagre results of the very-high-frequency </p>
<p>work led to the gradual elimination of that project. For some </p>
<p>reason, certain occasional bursts of skywave reception from an early </p>
<p>shortwave broadcast transmitter in Millie, Massachusetts, attracted </p>
<p>my attention. These, I felt, might be caused by reflection of the </p>
<p>signals from clouds of ionization produced by occasional large </p>
<p>meteors passing through the atmosphere more or less overhead. It had </p>
<p>been shown, in 1932, that a general increase in the ionization of </p>
<p>the E-layer could be observed at the time of a recognised meteor </p>
<p>Shower, but the fact was not widely known or believed. By studying </p>
<p>what was known about the relative frequency of large meteors and the </p>
<p>amount of energy dissipated by them, I was able to show that they </p>
<p>should be able to produce enough ionization about as often as was </p>
<p>needed to explain the effects observed.</p>
<p>This started a continuing interest in meteoric ionization, although </p>
<p>the study of it was somewhat frustrating. One never, of course, </p>
<p>knows when a large meteor may appear, while reflections from </p>
<p>ionization produced by smaller ones were not easily detectable with </p>
<p>the radar-like techniques and especially with the limited </p>
<p>transmitter power available before 1940. I used to dream of a </p>
<p>scenario in which I would observe the passage of a meteor which </p>
<p>actually fell to earth to be recovered. I could then, I thought, </p>
<p>give a lecture saying, "Here is the record produced by a meteor, </p>
<p>observed at a certain time; and, (reaching into a pocket), Here, </p>
<p>gentlemen, is the meteor". It is needless to say that such an </p>
<p>opportunity never came to me or, so far as I know, to anyone else.</p>
<p>It was gradually possible, in part before World War II and in part </p>
<p>in the first year or two afterward, to amass a series of records </p>
<p>showing reflections from meteoric ionization at times coinciding </p>
<p>with visual observations. This involved many tedious and chilling </p>
<p>hours watching for and counting visual meteors. The climax of these </p>
<p>efforts came one night about 1 A.M. when Catherine and I were </p>
<p>watching at the field station that the lab then maintained in </p>
<p>Weston, where we had a hut containing receiving equipment and where </p>
<p>the darkness of the sky made watching very productive. We had only </p>
<p>been there a few minutes, or long enough to get dark-adapted, when </p>
<p>the second-largest bolide I ever saw appeared almost overhead. It </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Meteroric">Meteoric Ionization</a></b> 100</p>
<p>was rather like a flaming full moon, except that it threw off sparks </p>
<p>of green and blue and left a trail in the sky that was visible for </p>
<p>about twenty minutes. As soon as I recovered from my surprise, I </p>
<p>rushed into the shack to see the radio reflection, only to discover </p>
<p>that the transmitter in Cambridge had failed. I dashed to the car </p>
<p>and drove to the laboratory, with little regard for speed limits, </p>
<p>and succeeded in getting the transmitter back on the air in time to </p>
<p>record the latter part of the reflection from the cloud of </p>
<p>ionization, which persisted for a total of forty-five minutes. </p>
<p>In 1946, the Draconid meteor shower of October 9th was predicted to </p>
<p>be exceptionally brilliant, as the earth would approach the orbit of </p>
<p>the parent comet soon after the comet had passed that point in its </p>
<p>orbit. This prediction was fulfilled by the biggest meteor shower in </p>
<p>my lifetime. Unfortunately it was cloudy in Massachusetts, but my </p>
<p>records showed at least four thousand "bright meteors in about three </p>
<p>hours", a number that agreed well with visual observations in other </p>
<p>places.</p>
<p>After the war, the availability of high-powered radar equipment made </p>
<p>meteor researches more rewarding, for other investigators, and the </p>
<p>results were often studied by far better physicists than I, so that </p>
<p>my early successes in the field were soon forgotten. It was, </p>
<p>however, an effort that greatly interested me and which has, in </p>
<p>other hands, led to many useful results. I do believe, however, that </p>
<p>I was the first to demonstrate that a radio (or radar) reflection </p>
<p>could be produced by a single meteor. </p>
<p>In June, 1938 there was a remarkable amount of sporadic E-region </p>
<p>ionization at the time when the season of the year and the cycle of </p>
<p>solar activity were both at their best. This sporadic ionization is </p>
<p>related to auroral activity, because both are produced by the </p>
<p>bombardment of the atmosphere by charged particles shot off from </p>
<p>active areas on the sun. Most patches of sporadic ionization are </p>
<p>small and seem to move in a way reminiscent of the motion of auroral </p>
<p>streamers. On several occasions in 1938 (and occasionally since </p>
<p>then) the ionization extended across areas a thousand miles or more </p>
<p>across and was also unusually intense. One result of this activity </p>
<p>was that hundreds of amateur radio contacts in the 56-megacycle band </p>
<p>were achieved across distances up to two or three thousand miles </p>
<p>instead of being restricted to a few tens of miles, as is usually </p>
<p>the case.</p>
<p>Through the courtesy of Ross Hull, the Technical Director of the </p>
<p>American Radio Relay League (an organization of radio amateurs), the </p>
<p>many reports of these phenomenal radio conversations were sent to me </p>
<p>for analysis. I was able to deduce the intensity of the ionization </p>
<p>as a function of geographical position and, besides plotting </p>
<p>contours to show the extent of the sporadic clouds, to show that </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meteoric Ionization 101</p>
<p>reflection had been possible up to a frequency of 150 megahertz, to </p>
<p>use the modern nomenclature. This means, in current term; that at </p>
<p>least the first few television channels should, if an equal </p>
<p>magnitude of sporadic ionization occurs again, be clearly seen at </p>
<p>distances of about a thousand miles. At the same time the FM band </p>
<p>might well have signals in hopeless confusion, for a short period. </p>
<p>In the 1938 case, there was at least one occasion when two large </p>
<p>clouds of ionization occupied the eastern and western halves of the </p>
<p>United States at the same tine, so that coast-to-coast 56-megahertz </p>
<p>transmission was possible for a few hours. I had the pleasure of </p>
<p>writing an account of this study in two contrasting styles, one for </p>
<p>publication in QST, the radio amateur periodical, and a second in </p>
<p>scientific language for the "Physical Review".</p>

<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Hurricane">The 1938 Hurricane</a></p>
</b><p>The hurricane that struck eastern New England in September, 1938, </p>
<p>was exciting, as no one in this area had seen anything like it for </p>
<p>more than a century. There was little or no warning, at least in the </p>
<p>Boston area. For some reason I had left work in the afternoon and </p>
<p>gone to a movie in Harvard Square. The storm, which had not been </p>
<p>noticeably severe, surprised me by its intensity when I came out </p>
<p>near dinnertime. I did not know what the storm was, but damage was </p>
<p>clearly being done. After I had eaten and thought it over and, I am </p>
<p>sure, after the rain had subsided and the wind had gone down </p>
<p>somewhat, I took a flashlight and patiently climbed each of the </p>
<p>three antenna towers on the Physics labs to see that none of the </p>
<p>many wires had torn loose. None had, strangely and luckily, as </p>
<p>trailing wires on such a night could have been hazardous.</p>
<p>In the morning I was horrified to find the lawns near Memorial Hall, </p>
<p>close to which I passed on my way from the lab to my room, were </p>
<p>thickly strewn with slates from the roof of the hall. These were </p>
<p>large and heavy, perhaps eighteen by thirty inches in dimensions, </p>
<p>and most of them were standing nearly upright, buried to half their </p>
<p>length in the ground. I never heard that anyone had been injured in </p>
<p>the fall of these slates, probably because few idiots would have </p>
<p>been abroad during the worst of the storm. On that morning after the </p>
<p>hurricane it became obvious that many towns in eastern and central </p>
<p>Massachusetts had been more or less cut off by high water, and some </p>
<p>of them had not been heard from as almost all wires were down. Doe </p>
<p>Selvidge and I then took the radio truck, that was liberally </p>
<p>supplied with batteries, and set out to see what "lost" towns we </p>
<p>could discover and assist by sending out messages if help were </p>
<p>needed. This was a largely useless effort as people were more self-</p>
<p>sufficient in those days and usually seemed to deal with their own </p>
<p>emergencies. We did, however, spend two nights and a day in this </p>
<p>humanitarian enterprise. Our greatest success was in finding a boy's </p>
<p>school in or near Ware, that was full of people anxious to get </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 1938 Hurricane 102</p>
<p>messages of reassurance to their families. We got all of these all </p>
<p>off by amateur radio (even though we were licensed as an </p>
<p>experimental station) and hoped that most of them got through. This </p>
<p>trip was sporting as many of the roads were under water and </p>
<p>intensive map study was needed to find ways to go in the directions </p>
<p>we thought necessary.</p>
<p>Brattle Street, the old Tory Row in Cambridge, was a sight of </p>
<p>desolation after the hurricane. It had been lined on both sides by </p>
<p>stately elms, most of which were uprooted by the storm. I fail to </p>
<p>remember how many days it took to clear the street enough for cars </p>
<p>to use it. This was my first experience with nature's wonderful </p>
<p>power of regeneration, helped in this case by man. After twenty </p>
<p>years I am sure that no stranger would have realized that any </p>
<p>disaster had occurred along Brattle Street. It is unfortunate that I </p>
<p>must also conclude that these beautiful trees would have been lost </p>
<p>to the Dutch elm disease in the next decades in any case. Few </p>
<p>villages and even cities were ever more beautiful than these old New </p>
<p>England towns with streets shaded by complete arches of these. </p>
<p>magnificent trees.</p>

<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Marriage">Mrs. Stillman / Marriage to Catherine</a></p>
</b><p>In the summer of 1937 I made the first of many visits to Catherine's </p>
<p>summer home in Brookfield, New York. This was the house in which </p>
<p>Catherine was born. She and her mother, Margaretta Adelia Taylor </p>
<p>Stillman, had lived elsewhere since 1918 but still maintained the </p>
<p>house, as we continue to do, for a summer residence. I immediately </p>
<p>became very fond of Mrs. Stillman, which no doubt helped to ease my </p>
<p>qualms about marrying again. After this and another visit or two in </p>
<p>1938, it was becoming obvious that a marriage would take place, </p>
<p>probably in the summer of 1939. when Mrs. Stillman upset our vague </p>
<p>plans. She had, while spending a semester with Catherine in Ann </p>
<p>Arbor, begun to correspond with an old acquaintance, Dr. Courtenay </p>
<p>Fean, whom she had had as a Sunday-school teacher some time prior to </p>
<p>1890, and who had spent most of the intervening years as a </p>
<p>missionary in China. The correspondence soon led to a visit or two. </p>
<p>I had been instructed to appear for inspection at the family </p>
<p>Christmas party in Hall, Nw York. Someone jokingly suggested that </p>
<p>Mrs. Stillman should invite Dr. Penn to the party. She took the </p>
<p>suggestion seriously, with the result that a day or two before </p>
<p>Christmas she went to the railroad station to meet his train at six </p>
<p>o'clock in the morning and appeared for breakfast wearing a new </p>
<p>diamond ring. This had the happy result that no one except Catherine </p>
<p>paid much attention to me during the party.</p>
<p>After returning to Cambridge, I soon learned that Mrs. Stillman and </p>
<p>Dr. Penn had decided to be married on February fourteenth. Catherine </p>
<p>and I felt that we would prefer that her mother announce our </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stillman / Marriage to Catherine 103</p>
<p>marriage before she changed her name, so we put on a burst of speed </p>
<p>and arranged to be married in Cambridge while Catherine and her </p>
<p>mother were on their way to New Jersey for the second wedding. As a </p>
<p>result Catherine and I were married on Saturday, February fourth, </p>
<p>1939, by Dean Sperry of the Harvard Divinity School in a very </p>
<p>private service at the Appleton Chapel in the Memorial Church. </p>
<p>Immediately after the ceremony, I found that Mrs. Stillman had </p>
<p>complicated our day. New Jersey required blood tests for the new </p>
<p>couple, although they were both past seventy, and attempts to have </p>
<p>one made in Michigan and reported to New Jersey had repeatedly gone </p>
<p>awry, because improper forms had been used or had not been signed by </p>
<p>a non-existent family physician, or for some other odd reason. Just </p>
<p>before Catherine's wedding, Mrs. Stillman had received a telephone </p>
<p>call from her fiance' saying that another effort had gone wrong and </p>
<p>recommending that she now have a blood sample taken and mailed to </p>
<p>New Jersey. As a result, Professors Hunt and Mimno took the wedding </p>
<p>party back to the Commander Hotel, where Catherine and her mother </p>
<p>had been staying, and we left my new wife in the lobby reading the </p>
<p>Boston Herald while I took Mrs. Stillman to my physician to have </p>
<p>another blood sample taken. After this necessary interruption, we </p>
<p>finally sat down to the wedding breakfast.</p>
<p>Fortunately Catherine and I stayed in Cambridge that weekend, while </p>
<p>her mother visited friends on the North Shore, because on Monday my </p>
<p>doctor telephoned in a state of irritation. Apparently the post </p>
<p>office had recognized the blood sample and instead of reading the </p>
<p>address had sent it to the Massachusets General Hospital. They had </p>
<p>also allowed it to get too hot so that the sample was useless. As </p>
<p>the licensing time required before Mother's wedding was rapidly </p>
<p>expiring, we telephoned to advise her to drop everything and get </p>
<p>into the state of New Jersey and have another blood test made. This </p>
<p>effort was successful and Mother, although anemic, got her license </p>
<p>with a few hours to spare and was married as she had wished, on </p>
<p>Saint Valentine's Day.</p>
<p>This turmoil amused Catherine because she herself had not needed to </p>
<p>do anything except to appear in time for the ceremony. Massachusetts </p>
<p>then required no blood test and, because of some quirk in the law, </p>
<p>I, being a resident of the State, had had to make all the </p>
<p>arrangements while Catherine, as a non-resident, had not even needed </p>
<p>to sign her name. Notwithstanding this lack of official interest in </p>
<p>her, I think that Catherine believes Dean Sperry's attestation on </p>
<p>her marriage certificate to be adequate proof of a valid ceremony. </p>
<p>So far as I can tell, I should say that this marriage was one of </p>
<p>Dean Sperry's most successful accomplishments.</p>
<p>After the New Jersey wedding, Catherine and I took the train to </p>
<p>Albany where we separated, she to go back to her graduate studies in </p>
<p>Michigan and I to whatever I was doing in Cambridge. Catherine </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marriage, continued / Mrs. Bridgeman 104</p>
<p>managed to stretch her Easter vacation to nearly a month, however, </p>
<p>so we spent part of it watching Gilbert and Sullivan, as the D'Oyly </p>
<p>Carte Company was then playing in Boston, and part of it in </p>
<p>attendance at the Physical Society meetings and others in </p>
<p>Washington.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1939, Miss Eliza Tuthill, an old friend of </p>
<p>Catherine and her mother, gave us a most delightful wedding present. </p>
<p>For two weeks she vacated her charming apartment in Flatbush, about </p>
<p>half a mile from the grounds of the New York World's Fair, and let </p>
<p>us use it as a base. We were thus able to exhaust our energy on the </p>
<p>fairgrounds and easily get back home to recuperate. Our favorite </p>
<p>spot was the Finnish Pavillion, small, simple, and beautifully </p>
<p>decorated, where they served the best coffee I had had since leaving </p>
<p>Finland in 1936. We spent many an hour there, resting our legs and </p>
<p>drinking coffee.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>In September Catherine and I set up housekeeping in Cambridge, </p>
<p>somewhat to the relief of the Department, which had heard that I had </p>
<p>been married but had seen no evidence of that fact. Catherine was </p>
<p>introduced to the Department ladies at the first wives' tea in the </p>
<p>fall. A high spot for her, and for me by hearsay, was when she was </p>
<p>presented to Mrs. Percy Bridgeman, the wife of the famous physicist </p>
<p>and philosopher who was to receive the Nobel Prize a few years </p>
<p>later. Mrs. Bridgeman was a sturdy New England matron with a heart </p>
<p>of gold and a somewhat forbidding exterior, who disliked the name </p>
<p>Percy and always called her husband Peter. Catherine had been </p>
<p>introduced and was ready to move on down the receiving line when </p>
<p>Mrs. Bridgeman did a double take. "Pierce", she said, "Mrs. Jack </p>
<p>Pierce?" Catherine admitted her identity, whereupon Mrs. Bridgeman </p>
<p>continued, "Oh Well, Peter told me to look you over and see how I </p>
<p>thought you'd do". I have always assured Catherine that she must </p>
<p>have passed inspection, because I remained at Harvard for another </p>
<p>thirty-five years.</p>
</font><p><hr>
<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Relections">Complex Reflections</a></p>
</b><p>At about the time we were married, my attention had been attracted </p>
<p>by some curious multiple reflections that occurred from time to time </p>
<p>on our records. These appeared as "stacks" of up to eight or ten </p>
<p>repeated bounces of a signal between the earth and the F-layer, that </p>
<p>would persist for ten or twenty minutes at a time, especially in the </p>
<p>hours following sunset. Most peculiarly, these stacks were often </p>
<p>skewed, so that after registering strong first and second </p>
<p>reflections there would be no further signals until, say, the </p>
<p>seventh multiple. After a minute or two, the sixth might appear, </p>
<p>followed presently by the fifth, and so on. After a while all of </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complex Reflections 105</p>
<p>these higher multiples would disappear, perhaps to come back again </p>
<p>once or twice at intervals of an hour or so.</p>
<p>After a lot of tedious calculations of possible ray paths, in which </p>
<p>Catherine very kindly helped for many weeks, I was able to </p>
<p>demonstrate that these anomalous reflections were the result of very </p>
<p>long-wavelength ripples in the reflecting layer, particularly at </p>
<p>times when the layer was not horizontal such as near sunrise and </p>
<p>sunset. These waves or, better, swells, could produce remarkable </p>
<p>results when they had an amplitude (in height) of only a half-</p>
<p>kilometer or a kilometer and a wavelength of several hundred </p>
<p>kilometers.</p>
<p>These studies led me to a long infatuation with what I may call </p>
<p>mechanical explanations of curiosities on our records, as opposed to </p>
<p>the effects produced by refraction and retardation of signals in the </p>
<p>ionized regions, or what is now called plasma physics. One at my </p>
<p>happiest moments was when I could show that a signal that had been </p>
<p>absent from Cambridge for as long as a tenth of a second (seen on </p>
<p>one of Olof Rydbeck's records) had travelled to approximately the </p>
<p>Gulf of Aden, where it had met the sunrise line in a region where </p>
<p>the layer had a steep slope and large curvature, and had been </p>
<p>reflected back by this obstacle and returned to Cambridge.</p>

<b><p><a name="SouthAfrica">The South African Trip</a></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1937 I began a campaign intended to result in another radio </p>
<p>eclipse expedition; this time to the (then) Union of South Africa in </p>
<p>1940. This campaign consisted largely in firmly telling everyone in </p>
<p>the lab that I was going to go, with the result that 1940 eventually </p>
<p>arrived without its having occurred to anyone to forbid the trip. I </p>
<p>had by no means the status to be expected for an expedition leader, </p>
<p>but persistence and a great deal or preparatory study worked quite </p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>For this trip I had the pleasure of raising my own funds (with, of </p>
<p>course, Harvard's name behind me). which was a far different matter </p>
<p>before World War II. I begged $500 or $1,000 successfully from each </p>
<p>of several sources, such as the Milton Fund at Harvard, the American </p>
<p>Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, </p>
<p>and even from the Radio Corporation of America. I learned how to </p>
<p>coordinate my requests with those of others at Harvard, so that my </p>
<p>plea for a small sum would not be sent to a potential donor who </p>
<p>might be considering a larger gift to someone else. I was especially </p>
<p>delighted when, worried about possibly-increasing costs because of </p>
<p>the war, at the last minute I approached the Director of Cruft </p>
<p>Laboratory, Professor G.W. Pierce, and asked him if he would like to </p>
<p>contribute $500 as an emergency fund. Although G.W. had, so far as I </p>
<p>know, a clean record of not contributing to the research programs of </p>
<p>youngsters, I found myself leaving his office within a minute with </p>
<p>his check in my hand.</p>
<p>Much of my time for the last year or so before 1940 went into </p>
<p>building equipment for the expedition. I made two main devices; a </p>
<p>transmitter and receiver that could be operated manually to trace </p>
<p>the minute-to-minute variations in the critical frequencies of the </p>
<p>ionospheric layers, and an automatic transmitter and receiver that </p>
<p>recorded layer height as a function of time at no less than eight </p>
<p>fixed frequencies simultaneously. In the days before digital</p>
<p>techniques, this had to be an analog device. It was something of a </p>
<p>mechanical monstrosity but it worked very well. I had, of course, </p>
<p>spent weeks learning how to compute the circumstances of the eclipse </p>
<p>at various places so that I could, with the aid of the South and </p>
<p>East African Yearbook, choose an appropriate site. This large </p>
<p>handbook, I remember, delighted us with its references to the </p>
<p>available facilities in various places. Most of the hotels in the </p>
<p>small towns had what the handbook chastely called the "nightly pail </p>
<p>removal system of sanitation". Fortunately we were able to occupy a </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>somewhat better establishment.</p>
<p>In correspondence and in assisting with arrangements with the South </p>
<p>African government, Professor Basil F. J. Schonland, the Director of </p>
<p>the Bernard Price Institute of Geophysics at the University of the </p>
<p>Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, was of the greatest benefit to us. </p>
<p>Dr. Schonland was a great expert on lightning (taking advantage of a </p>
<p>natural resource in which South Africa excels, as we were to find </p>
<p>out to our sorrow), who later became the head of the British atomic </p>
<p>energy establishment and lived to become Sir Basil. Incidentally, </p>
<p>Dr. Schonland's little book for popular consumption, "The Flight of </p>
<p>Thunderbolts", is probably still the best simple introduction to the </p>
<p>real facts about lightning.</p>
<p>The South African government was (or were, in South African form) </p>
<p>most considerate and helpful, giving us free transportation for our </p>
<p>equipment and various minor benefactions. After World War II began, </p>
<p>there was, of course, a lot of uncertainty but, under Dr. </p>
<p>Schonland's urging, the government took only a relatively short time </p>
<p>to decide to let us proceed with our project.</p>
<p>The original plan had been to take three graduate students, Joe </p>
<p>de Bettencourt, Joe Keary, and Bill Read. They all helped in getting </p>
<p>equipment ready and in learning to use it. The outbreak of war, </p>
<p>however, had a most discouraging effect on our plans, as ships on </p>
<p>which we had reservations kept disappearing. I think that only one </p>
<p>was actually sunk, but others were unexpectedly sold to the British </p>
<p>so that, in the end, we lost our reservations five times. At the </p>
<p>last desperate moment, I happened to be in the office of the </p>
<p>American South African Line when two astronomers supported by the </p>
<p>National Geographic Society came in to say that they were giving up </p>
<p>their plans, and I promptly seized the vacated places on the S.S. </p>
<p>Lancaster.</p>
<p>Because these were the only two reservations we were able to get, it </p>
<p>was necessary to revise our plans. Mostly from selfishness but </p>
<p>partly because it was too hard to choose the graduate student who </p>
<p>most deserved to go, I decided to leave all of them at home and take </p>
<p>Catherine, whose mother had kindly contributed a thousand dollars to </p>
<p>help with the costs of her trip. This led to an amusing error when </p>
<p>Catherine sent a check for $44O to Harvard to cover her half of our </p>
<p>steamship fare. Someone in the administration misunderstood the </p>
<p>situation so that she presently received from the President's office </p>
<p>a beautiful and formal document thanking her profusely for her </p>
<p>donation. It seemed far better to leave this alone, so we did not </p>
<p>try to explain the mistake.</p>
<p>In this emergency, Dr. Schonland came through in his usual fine </p>
<p>style. He found for us four first-year graduates from two South </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="PrepforSA">Preparations for South Africa</b> </a>108</p>
<p>African Universities, one English and one Afrikaans, who would work </p>
<p>for the expedition for various periods for the sake of the </p>
<p>experience, provided that their expenses were paid. In the end, we </p>
<p>gave them a bit of pocket money as well and they were all as eager </p>
<p>and helpful as could be desired. Catherine also was as useful as </p>
<p>anyone, so Harvard made an excellent fiscal bargain.</p>
<p>One other difficulty threatened to disrupt our plans at the last </p>
<p>moment. Effective on the first of July, a few days before we were to </p>
<p>sail, the United States placed an embargo of the exportation of </p>
<p>materials that might be useful in the war effort. This list included </p>
<p>quartz crystals, I remember, and various other things that we had to </p>
<p>take with us. I rushed to Washington to see the State Department </p>
<p>people who had been most helpful in endorsing our requests for </p>
<p>permission to use our transmitters and in making other necessary </p>
<p>diplomatic arrangements. No one had any objection to our taking what </p>
<p>we needed, but unfortunately the law was so new that the requisite </p>
<p>forms for asking for exemptions had not even been prepared. After </p>
<p>some turmoil the head of the Division of International </p>
<p>Communications cut the Gordian knot. He simply telephoned the </p>
<p>Collector of Customs at New York and instructed him verbally to </p>
<p>release our equipment. He further endeared the State Department to </p>
<p>me by paying for the telephone call.</p>
<p>This period of tension was relieved by one small episode. Catherine </p>
<p>had stopped to see her mother in New Jersey while I was in </p>
<p>Washington. Roger Hickman, who had been representing the Harvard </p>
<p>administration in coordinating my efforts, happened to be in New </p>
<p>York to make a speech. To keep him advised, Catherine tried to </p>
<p>telephone him at the Harvard Club, only to find him out at the time. </p>
<p>Trying to achieve simplicity and clarity, she left a message to the </p>
<p>effect that Mr. Pierce has gone to Washington; Mrs. Pierce can be </p>
<p>reached at a certain Montclair telephone number. It was only later </p>
<p>that she found that the Harvard Club's way of dealing with such </p>
<p>messages was to type them out and post them on the Club bulletin </p>
<p>board. I think we had been back from South Africa a long time before </p>
<p>the Harvard Club allowed Roger to forget this message.</p>
<p>The day finally came when our equipment had been loaded and we were </p>
<p>to report to the Lancaster at the Bush docks in Brooklyn. A small </p>
<p>and happy group came to see us off: two or three New York friends, </p>
<p>two boys from the lab with one girl friend, and Dick Dow, the </p>
<p>entomologist and old friend of Catherine with his fiancee Mary </p>
<p>Johnson, who had been a close friend of Catherine at Mount Holyoke. </p>
<p>We were a little surprised that we had to go to the pier entrance to </p>
<p>identify our guests before they could come to the ship. After a high </p>
<p>tea for the group, we found that the sailing would be postponed for </p>
<p>at least a day. The best plan would be to return to Manhattan and </p>
<p>check by telephone occasionally until we learned the true sailing </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="SS">The S.S.Lancaster</b> </a>109</p>
<p>time. This allowed us two very pleasant days of vacationing in New </p>
<p>York. Some guests had to leave us but Dick and Mary and Joe deB and </p>
<p>his girl stayed on until we actually sailed. We had a chance to </p>
<p>visit the world's Fair again, at which I particularly remember the </p>
<p>Hot Mikado. We were intrigued to find how little it was possible to </p>
<p>change Sullivan's music even when it was supposed to be played as </p>
<p>jazz. In New York the highlight was certainly Dick's gift of an </p>
<p>evening at Life with Father, which was then enjoying its first run.</p>
<p>It was probably as well that we had some entertainment before </p>
<p>beginning our voyage, as the Lancaster was so slow that the trip to </p>
<p>Capetown took thirty-one days. We traversed the great circle route </p>
<p>of nearly eight thousand miles at an average speed of nine and a </p>
<p>half knots. It was the only ocean voyage either of us ever took that </p>
<p>threatened to last too long; we had to admit that during the last </p>
<p>week (when the South Atlantic swell had reached us and on every </p>
<p>watch the log entry read vessel rolling heavily) we began to feel </p>
<p>that it would be good to be ashore.</p>
<p>The Lancaster was a typical small freighter that had never carried </p>
<p>passengers. For this trip the owners had taken out the furnishings </p>
<p>of the pilot's room and installed a double-deck bunk and two small </p>
<p>bureaus. Catherine had the pleasure of finding herself the only </p>
<p>woman on board, surrounded by me and a crew of thirty-nine. We, of </p>
<p>course, ate at the Captain's table because there was no other. </p>
<p>Except that the first and third mates were on poor terms, we found </p>
<p>all the officers pleasant and friendly and had a very relaxing trip.</p>
<p>The Lancaster sailed brightly lighted, with big American flags </p>
<p>painted on both sides and illuminated by floodlights at night. Our </p>
<p>faith in this protection from German submarines became a little less </p>
<p>than perfect when we learned that much of the ship's cargo was </p>
<p>contraband from the German point of view. The only items I now </p>
<p>recall were automobile or truck chassis to be made into armored cars </p>
<p>and a large consignment of tetraethyl lead for the Royal Air Force </p>
<p>in Kenya. We found that the reason for the delay in our departure </p>
<p>was that the ship was carrying calcium carbide in burlap bags which </p>
<p>could be loaded only in perfectly dry weather.</p>
<p>Captain Baker was a short and somewhat plump man about sixty years </p>
<p>of age, who had grown up in sail along the coast of Maine. Although </p>
<p>he looked more like a Teddy Bear than a ship's captain, we soon </p>
<p>noticed that he commanded a very tight ship where everything ran </p>
<p>like clockwork with no apparent effort. We came to appreciate his </p>
<p>quality two or three days after leaving New York, when he told us at </p>
<p>breakfast that there would be a fire and boat drill that morning. He</p>
<p>assured us that we need take no part in this but suggested that we </p>
<p>might well go on deck and watch the exercise. "If anything happens", </p>
<p>he continued, "You children head for the first boat you can see; if </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Baker">Captain Baker</b> </a>110</p>
<p>you get there before me, you'll know you've been in a footrace".</p>
<p>We were especially impressed when we got into the tropics. Captain </p>
<p>Baker would then pull out onto the wing of the bridge an old wicker </p>
<p>rocking chair that had been left on board by the wife of some former </p>
<p>captain. He would tie knots in the four corners of a handkerchief to </p>
<p>protect his bald head, and sit in the sun and rock for hours at a </p>
<p>time. When we enquired how he could do this and maintain the respect </p>
<p>of the crew, the chief engineer explained by reciting innumerable </p>
<p>accounts demonstrating the captain's readiness to grab a belaying </p>
<p>pin (or whatever the steamship equivalent may be) and personally </p>
<p>subdue any violence that occurred.</p>
<p>Somewhere southwest of the Cape Verde Islands I was aroused one </p>
<p>morning by a peculiar noise, Sticking my head out of the porthole, I </p>
<p>was just in time to see the tremendous flukes of a whale as it </p>
<p>sounded about a dozen yards from the ship. On only one other </p>
<p>occasion did we find a whale close enough to let us see more than a </p>
<p>spout.</p>
<p>Although Captain Baker had been sailing to Capetown and up the east </p>
<p>coast of Africa for twenty years, he had never seen St. Helena, </p>
<p>which lay about fifty miles off the great circle route. To humor us </p>
<p>"children", he altered the course by a couple of degrees to bring us </p>
<p>within sight of the island. We had greatly enjoyed watching the </p>
<p>albatrosses and the flying fish, but it was a pleasant change to see </p>
<p>a little green in the seascape again. Our arrival in those waters </p>
<p>was unexpected, so we were intercepted by an old flying boat with a </p>
<p>pusher propeller, that looked as though it had been made by Glenn </p>
<p>Curtis at the time of World War I. This craft circled us for a while </p>
<p>asking questions by blinker. It amused me to find that I was able to </p>
<p>read there messages better than any of the ship's officers, but I </p>
<p>kept this knowledge to myself and let them explain what was </p>
<p>happening.</p>
<p>We chanced to reach Capetown just at sunset, which gave us a </p>
<p>spectacular view of the harbor, amazingly full of ships, with the </p>
<p>city and Table Mountain forming a backdrop of unusual majesty. </p>
<p>Because the antisubmarine net had already been closed, we had to lie </p>
<p>completely blacked out in the outer harbor until morning. We felt </p>
<p>that this blackout was remarkably silly, as we were perfectly </p>
<p>silhouetted against the brightly illuminated city and enjoying the </p>
<p>light of a full moon. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><p><hr>
<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Capetown"></a>Capetown</b> 111</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We docked in the morning and were most conveniently met by Mr. and </p>
<p>Mrs. Thompson, who had somehow wangled permission to come aboard. </p>
<p>Mrs. Thompson was an American, a sister of a friend of a friend of </p>
<p>Catherine (if I have it correctly) who had married a South African </p>
<p>and lived in retirement in Muizenburg, not far from Capetown.</p>
<p>It seemed that Dr. Wood, the Director of the Union Observatory and </p>
<p>thus the ex-officio chief of the South African eclipse activities, </p>
<p>had communicated with both the immigration and customs officers, so </p>
<p>we were passed into the country with the greatest ease. I declared </p>
<p>and paid duty on a few personal comsumable items, notably ten </p>
<p>cartons of American cigarets that I had bought on the Lancaster for </p>
<p>$7.00. It was good that Mr. Thompson was there to lend me the money, </p>
<p>as the duty on the cigarets was no less than four pounds; closely </p>
<p>enough, we may say that a pound was equal to $4.00, a shilling to 20 </p>
<p>cents, and sixpence to 10 cents, at the time of this trip. After we </p>
<p>had finished at the dock, the Thompsons drove us to the Mount Nelson </p>
<p>Hotel, after introducing us to the custom of morning tea. The Mount </p>
<p>Nelson was the most stuffy hotel im my experience, partly because it </p>
<p>was largely occupied by expatriates (many of them titled) who had </p>
<p>not cared to remain in England after the war started. The hotel was </p>
<p>mostly memorable, for us, because it had a large aviary of finches </p>
<p>in the lobby, thus introducing us to these charming birds, of which </p>
<p>we later kept many.</p>
<p>In Capetown we dealt with the problems of shipping our equipment to </p>
<p>Queenstown and paid calls upon professors at the University of </p>
<p>Capetown with whom we had corresponded. We also called upon the </p>
<p>American Minister and at the Southern Branch of Greenwich </p>
<p>Observatory, which was directed by Professor Jackson whose title </p>
<p>was, I believe, His Majesty's Astronomer at the Cape. After having </p>
<p>us for dinner, Dr. Jackson showed us through the Observatory after </p>
<p>dark. This tour was chiefly memorable because of the Director's </p>
<p>Scots economy, no doubt reinforced by a tight budget. In each room </p>
<p>he would turn on one 25-watt bulb, and then go back to turn off the </p>
<p>light in the preceding room before telling us what we were seeing. </p>
<p>We were amused to find that the handsome main building had been </p>
<p>designed in the northern hemisphere and then built in Capetown </p>
<p>exactly as shown on the plans, so that it faced away from the sun </p>
<p>instead of toward it, as intended.</p>
<p>The Thompsons drove us on two or three sightseeing tours, including </p>
<p>one to beautiful Stellenbosch, to meet Professor Naude', the head of </p>
<p>the Physics Department at the (Afrikaans) University of Stellen </p>
<p>bosch. Dr. Naude' introduced us to the two students who were </p>
<p>presently to come to help us, Pieter Zeeman and J. C. Roelofse.</p>
<p>We did some shopping, partly for film for various cameras lent us by </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Capetown 112</p>
<p>Clyde Fisher of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. </p>
<p>We had met Dr. Fisher at the time of the eclipse in Kazakhstan, and </p>
<p>he had planned to come with us to South Africa to take care of our </p>
<p>photographic chores. When he had to withdraw at the last moment, he </p>
<p>covered his confusion by offering us a large assortment of cameras, </p>
<p>of which we accepted two or three. We had great difficulty in </p>
<p>declining the loan of Carl Akeley's original movie camera, developed </p>
<p>for his famous animal photographs in Africa. We did not care to be </p>
<p>responsible for such a rare and historic item and finally succeeded </p>
<p>in leaving New York without it. The films we bought were, after the </p>
<p>duty on my cigarets, our first introduction to South African prices. </p>
<p>We discovered that services, all provided by natives, were extremely </p>
<p>cheap while manufactured items, mostly imported, cost at least three </p>
<p>times as much as in the United States.</p>
<p>After two nights and a day in a very slow and cindery train that </p>
<p>jolted so much that we could not do the writing we had expected to </p>
<p>do, we arrived at Queenstown on the morning of August 20 and, as </p>
<p>planned, transferred to the Hexagon Hotel. The hotel took its name </p>
<p>from its location on the central hexagonal park in a town originally </p>
<p>laid out, for defensive reasons, with six wide streets radiating </p>
<p>from a central fort, now no longer in existence. The streets of the </p>
<p>town therefore have much of the form of a spiders web, with the </p>
<p>curious result that a driver often finds himself making one hundred </p>
<p>and twenty degree turns and very seldom, if ever, making one of only </p>
<p>sixty degrees. </p>
<p>Queenstown lies a hundred-odd miles in from the coast toward the </p>
<p>eastern side of the Cape Province. We had chosen it primarily </p>
<p>because, compared with the other towns in the eclipse track, it </p>
<p>combined the attractions of a good hotel and the most powerful </p>
<p>municipal electric plant. The latter point turned out to be most </p>
<p>convenient for us, as the QED (Queenstown Blectricity Department) </p>
<p>officials were very interested and helpful, and sold us all the </p>
<p>electricity we wanted at 3/4 of a penny per kilowatt hour.</p>
<p>The proprietors of the hotel, Mr. and Mrs. Verwoerd (pronounced </p>
<p>fairvort) received us most kindly and gave us the best room, </p>
<p>fortunately with a fireplace, for the startlingly-low price of three </p>
<p>pounds a week each, with all our meals. When our boys arrived they </p>
<p>were accomodated in more ordinary rooms for 2/10/0 per week. At </p>
<p>first we were somewhat inhibited by the rigid schedule for meals </p>
<p>morning tea or coffee at seven, breakfast at eight, lunch at one, </p>
<p>dinner at seven; with tea served in the lounge at eleven A.M. and </p>
<p>four and nine P.M. Even the evening tea was, we found, a universal </p>
<p>habit. One of its advantages was to help a single-feature movie last </p>
<p>all evening. After the latest British, American, and South African </p>
<p>newsreels and perhaps a Donald Duck, the lights would come on for </p>
<p>three quarters of an hour so that the audience could troop across </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="CtoQ">Capetown to Queenstown, Cape Province</b> </a>113</p>
<p>the street to the local tea room. When everyone had had tea and a </p>
<p>chance to visit with neighbors and friends, the audience would </p>
<p>return to the theater for the main picture. We learned to like this </p>
<p>custom and found it an improvement over feeling that we ought to sit </p>
<p>through a second feature of dubious quality.</p>
<p>After the Hexagon Hotel had become used to us and our peculiar ways, </p>
<p>and especially when it was discovered that we tipped by American </p>
<p>standards, which meant that we divided ten percent of our small bill </p>
<p>among half a dozen or more of the servants (for which we found </p>
<p>ourselves unpopular with some of the other guests at the hotel, who </p>
<p>accused us of spoiling the natives) it became possible to introduce </p>
<p>a little flexibility to accomodate our mealtimes to the necessities </p>
<p>of our work. We found that the hotel was happy to put up sandwiches </p>
<p>in lieu of fixed meals so that these, with our own purchases of </p>
<p>biscuits and fruit, helped us through periods when it was impossible </p>
<p>to get to the hotel at mealtime. One of our first calls was upon the </p>
<p>Town Clerk, who introduced us to the Town Engineer and Mr. Ashley, </p>
<p>the head of the QED. We wanted to find two operating sites, a couple </p>
<p>of miles apart, and these gentlemen were most kind in driving us </p>
<p>around to inspect possible places. We quickly adopted one for the </p>
<p>multi-frequency transmitter at an abandoned brewery that had four-</p>
<p>story brick walls enclosing almost nothing. The town engineer </p>
<p>repaired a couple of rooms for us and the QED set steel poles where </p>
<p>required for antennas in the yard, so we soon had a place to store </p>
<p>our equipment and set up the transmitter. Someone suggested that Dr. </p>
<p>Ritchie, the local general practitioner, had a cottage three miles </p>
<p>south of town that he might lend to us. This turned out to be a neat </p>
<p>one-story brick cottage on the doctor's estate. Like the doctor's </p>
<p>house, this cottage was separated from the road by a field and a </p>
<p>small stream and approached through a drift, or ford. The doctor was </p>
<p>reluctant to let us use the cottage because he had in the past </p>
<p>allowed some of the natives, who worked on his farm, to live in it </p>
<p>for a time. The natives, unfortunately, had not cared to use the </p>
<p>fireplaces and had built fires in the centers of the rooms. As a </p>
<p>result, the place was not only infested but stunk strongly of </p>
<p>creosote and had two-root holes burned through the floor in each </p>
<p>room. When he realized that we planned to live at the hotel and use </p>
<p>the cottage only for working purposes, Dr. Ritchie agreed to let us </p>
<p>use it provided only that we would have it professionally fumigated </p>
<p>before we occupied it. The Health Department did this for us and </p>
<p>sealed the building, full of cyanide gas, for a day or two for a </p>
<p>modest fee. We actually found the holes in the floors to be a great </p>
<p>convenience. We set wooden boxes, used for tea tables or other </p>
<p>purposes, over the holes except for sweeping accumulated dust and </p>
<p>dirt through the apertures. We covered the window of the small </p>
<p>kitchen, which had cold running water, and converted it to a </p>
<p>creditable dark room for developing our photographic records.</p>

<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Settling">Settling in Queenstown</b> </a>114</p>
<p>The day after we arrived in Queenstown, we retained Mr. Verwoerd to </p>
<p>drive us to Grahamstown to meet Dr. Varder, the Professor of </p>
<p>Physics, and others at (the English) Rhodes University College, from </p>
<p>which Dr. Schonland had arranged for two students to help us. We had </p>
<p>a pleasant one hundred mile trip featured by a beautiful climb over </p>
<p>a minor mountain range called the Katberg. A notable feature was a </p>
<p>sanitarium, or some such institution, at which it was convenient to </p>
<p>stop for tea, made memorable by about the most delicious scones I </p>
<p>ever encountered anywhere.</p>
<p>Grahamstown was an attractive college town with a pretty public </p>
<p>garden and a handsome Anglican church. Professor Varder was very </p>
<p>kind and hospitable, and introduced us to our two boys, Mike </p>
<p>Szendrei and Jack Gledhill. Mike had an interesting heritage, we </p>
<p>found. He had a Hungarian father and an Italian mother. He was born </p>
<p>in the free city of Trieste, went to school in western Europe, and </p>
<p>lived in the Belgian Congo when not at college in South Africa. He </p>
<p>became our first recruit as, on very short notice, he went off to </p>
<p>pack his things and returned to Queenstown with us.</p>
<p>Another very valuable assistant appeared in the person of Bob </p>
<p>Verwoerd, the son of the hotel proprietors and a radio amateur who </p>
<p>had been ruled off the air because of the war. Bob helped us off and </p>
<p>on until his exams at Queens College (a preparatory school) ended </p>
<p>three weeks before the eclipse. After he was free, he worked with us </p>
<p>as hard as anyone and for a longer period than any of the other </p>
<p>boys. The school also provided Mr. Dugmore, the Science Master, who </p>
<p>helped us at odd moments and became our time-keeper during the </p>
<p>eclipse.</p>
<p>After this, all was activity. We (mostly Catherine) cleaned the </p>
<p>cottage to a reasonable degree. We installed the manually-operated </p>
<p>equipment and the multi-frequency receiver, and built very </p>
<p>complicated antennas (to cover all needed frequencies) suspended </p>
<p>from a dozen or more poles the QED installed for us. It was soon </p>
<p>made clear to us that in South Africa white people do not work. If </p>
<p>anything, they supervise. The various persons, especially ladies, </p>
<p>who tried to call on us could not understand why we were always busy </p>
<p>and, generally, dirty. The great name of Harvard, however, protected </p>
<p>us. Parenthetically, I have always found that the respect in which </p>
<p>the name of Harvard is held is at least proportional to the distance </p>
<p>from Cambridge. I think that in Queenstown we became generally </p>
<p>regarded as good people, although peculiar, even though we could </p>
<p>seldom accept invitations, even in the evenings.</p>
<p>One exception to this rule, if it was a rule, was in favor of Mayor </p>
<p>and Mrs. Glover. The Mayor had tried in vain to call on us two or </p>
<p>three times in the first busy days, to the amazement of the people </p>
<p>at the hotel, and finally had left word that he would be in his </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Rood">Activities in Queenstown / The Cape Rood</b> </a>115</p>
<p>office at a certain time. We visited him then and were, of course, </p>
<p>promptly taken to tea. He invited us to his home for dinner the next </p>
<p>day. I have always remembered Mrs. Glover with affection because </p>
<p>she, in honor of the foreign guests, had studied her American </p>
<p>cookbook and produced an excellent beef stew for us. This was such a </p>
<p>relief from the bad English hotel cooking and such a thoughtful </p>
<p>thing for her to do that we have never forgotten it.</p>
</font><p><hr>
<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Technique">The Technique of Our Measurements</a></p>
</b><p>One of our early projects in Queenstown was to retain a surveyor to </p>
<p>determine our precise geographical position. This work was done by </p>
<p>the son of the local expert, a young man who had recently graduated </p>
<p>from Capetown University. His job was easy, as Queenstown was </p>
<p>surrounded by several mountains that still had markers standing </p>
<p>after a recent general triangulation in that area. The work was done </p>
<p>with the most beautiful transit I have ever seen, a Swiss instrument </p>
<p>of compact beauty that had been a graduation present from the </p>
<p>father. It was not much larger than an old Brownie No. 2 camera and </p>
<p>had knobs and lenses sticking out in all directions. It contained </p>
<p>various intricate devices, such as an optical plumb-bob, and was </p>
<p>direct reading to a second of arc.</p>
<p>The young man presently brought us a report. It said that the </p>
<p>cottage was 934,401.21 cape roods south of the equator and 2,142.36 </p>
<p>cape roods west of the 27th meridian east. When I asked to have this </p>
<p>expressed in latitude and longitude, it turned out that the numbers </p>
<p>had to be sent back to the boy's professor at Capetown for </p>
<p>translation. Fortunately, even with this delay, the results arrived </p>
<p>in good time and were certainly accurate, as the time of the eclipse </p>
<p>was within a half a second of our calculations, which was as closely </p>
<p>as we could measure it.</p>
<p>This episode interested me in the cape rood, and I presently found a </p>
<p>book that explained its somewhat ridiculous history. Early in the </p>
<p>nineteenth century, after the British had captured the area, a </p>
<p>military engineer was set to work surveying the Cape region. He sent </p>
<p>to Europe for a standard twelve foot bar and used it to calibrate </p>
<p>his surveying equipment. After about three years it became evident </p>
<p>that something was wrong. Investigation disclosed that the standard </p>
<p>bar had a length of twelve Heidelburg feet, or about twelve feet </p>
<p>five inches in English measure. In order to avoid the work required </p>
<p>to correct the small amount of surveying that had already been done, </p>
<p>the government of the colony simply defined this bar as the standard </p>
<p>cape rood. The survey of South Africa was continued, at least until </p>
<p>1940, in terms at this unit.</p>
<p>Our second official helper was Jack Gledhill who came in early </p>
<p>September and stayed until a couple of days after the eclipse, which </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Technique of Our Measurements 116</p>
<p>was on October first. Pieter Zeeman came to us about two weeks </p>
<p>before the eclipse, soon followed by Roelofse (I think his nickname </p>
<p>was also Jack but he was never called anything but Roelofse). These </p>
<p>two Stellenbosch boys stayed until the middle of October. I have </p>
<p>always been happy that two of our boy; Gledhill and Zeeman, </p>
<p>succeeded, inside of twenty years, to the headships of the Physics </p>
<p>departments at their respective Universities; the positions held by </p>
<p>Professors Varder and Naude' at the time of our trip. Both have </p>
<p>visited us in the United States and we are delighted to keep in </p>
<p>touch with them. Jack Gledhill has even continued to do his research </p>
<p>in ionospheric problems. We are sorry that after the first few years </p>
<p>we lost contact with the other two students and with Bob Verwoerd </p>
<p>who, we know, at least went on to the University of the </p>
<p>Witwatersrand. We remember all of these boys with great affection </p>
<p>and gratitude.</p>
<p>Our technical problem was to determine the changes in atmospheric </p>
<p>ionization caused by the eclipse and see what conclusions could be </p>
<p>drawn from them. This problem was complicated by the fact that the </p>
<p>ionization varies, sometimes rapidly, and can never be predicted </p>
<p>with great accuracy and especially because no ionospheric records </p>
<p>had been made in South Africa. It was known that there the earth's </p>
<p>magnetic field was relatively weak; a phenomenon that would have its </p>
<p>effect upon radio reflections from the ionosphere. It was therefore </p>
<p>essential to gather background data to define the South African </p>
<p>normal conditions. Our general plan was to make observations for a </p>
<p>month or more before and after the eclipse.</p>
<p>Ionospheric observations are made by finding out the apparent </p>
<p>heights reached by signals reflected from an ionized layer at </p>
<p>various frequencies. As the frequency increases, the signal </p>
<p>penetrates more and more deeply into the layer until it passes </p>
<p>completely tbrough it and, if not reflected by a higher layer, </p>
<p>disappears into space. By transmitting short pulses of signal and </p>
<p>receiving them near the transmitter, the Interval between </p>
<p>transmission and reception is a direct measurement of the apparent </p>
<p>height reached by the signal. Since we obviously cannot transmit at </p>
<p>all frequencies all the time, it is usually necessary to choose </p>
<p>whether to measure height at a fixed frequency as time goes by, or </p>
<p>to measure (over as short a time as is convenient) the height as a </p>
<p>function of frequency.</p>
<p>In Queenstown, as suggested above, we had instruments that worked </p>
<p>each way. The general variations were measured by the multi-</p>
<p>frequency equipment that recorded at eight frequencies continuously. </p>
<p>The rapidly-varying data, particularly of the critical frequency, or </p>
<p>the highest frequency that could be reflected from each layer, were </p>
<p>followed as rapidly as possible by manual equipment. This consisted </p>
<p>of a transmitter and a receiver, each with several frequency bands, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Practice">Practice / High Static</b> </a>117</p>
<p>that sat side by side on a table, so arranged that one could be </p>
<p>tuned with each hand. The receiver output was photographically </p>
<p>recorded in the form of layer height plotted against time. This </p>
<p>combination was used occasionally for complete sweeps through all </p>
<p>useful frequencies, but was usually used to make short sweeps that </p>
<p>included one or another of the critical frequencies that were </p>
<p>especially important. The reflections were also observed on an </p>
<p>oscilloscope so that the precision with which the receiver tuning </p>
<p>matched that of the transmitter could be judged. Moderate practice </p>
<p>made it possible to keep this correspondence accurate and still </p>
<p>locate the critical frequencies rapidly.</p>
<p>Because these manual records were made as a function of time, it was </p>
<p>necessary to make notes more or less continuously, keeping track of </p>
<p>the frequencies at which each sweep began and ended, at least, and </p>
<p>of the time of day. This problem was gradually reduced by the </p>
<p>development of a system that added tine and frequency marks to the </p>
<p>records. Each mark was produced by a telegraph key, one operated by </p>
<p>one foot and one by the other. This kept the operator quite busy and </p>
<p>still did not completely eliminate the need for written notes. When </p>
<p>speed was especially important, these chores were divided so that, </p>
<p>at the very least, the operator had an assistant making the notes </p>
<p>for him. During the eclipse, we had a timekeeper who made the time </p>
<p>marks and also announced the time of day and the time remaining </p>
<p>before each contact, while two other assistants made the frequency </p>
<p>marks and kept the written notes.</p>
<p>The weeks before the eclipse were devoted to this manual operation, </p>
<p>planned to produce the optimum background data; to tending the </p>
<p>automatic multifrequency equipment (which displayed an unfortunate </p>
<p>tendency to blow fuses, usually for no reason we could find); and to </p>
<p>routine chores like developing records, teaching our assistants to </p>
<p>operate; and, of course, to making and serving tea at the customary </p>
<p>times for our crew and for the many visitors who came to see what </p>
<p>was going on.</p>
<p>Two things contributed to my anxiety as the day of the eclipse </p>
<p>approached. One was the fact that we rapidly ran through our stock </p>
<p>of spare thyratrons (gas filled triodes), one of which was used to </p>
<p>generate our multifrequenoy pulses. These vacuum tubes did not seem </p>
<p>to be available in South Africa, and I think that one kind of </p>
<p>accident or another disposed of five of them before or during our </p>
<p>first fortnight of operation. Fortunately, the last one we had </p>
<p>settled down to its duties and worked faithfully for the remaining </p>
<p>two months. A more threatening problem was heavy static, or </p>
<p>interference caused by lightning flashes. These, at times, had an </p>
<p>intensity that I had never seen in the United States or, for that </p>
<p>matter, in Russia. The reason was the prevalence and violence of </p>
<p>thunderstorms that would form and sometimes persist for days, as the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Practice / High Static 118</p>
<p>rainy season was trying to get itself organized. This heavy noise </p>
<p>frequently completely masked our reflected signals, especially in </p>
<p>the late afternoon (at which time we expected the eclipse) and in </p>
<p>the evening. On two occasions, one of them only two days before the </p>
<p>eclipse, this static was so intense that even the extremely strong </p>
<p>local pulse, coupled directly from the manual transmitter into the </p>
<p>receiver, could not be distinguished on the monitor or oscilloscope. </p>
<p>It must have been at this time that I was heard to say that I must </p>
<p>be the first scientist to travel ten thousand miles to see an </p>
<p>eclipse and then pray for rain, which I thought would be required to </p>
<p>quiet the static. Fortunately, in the event, we had both good seeing </p>
<p>and low static.</p>
<p>Another minor, as it turned out, problem was severe interference </p>
<p>produced by power leaks on the local electric system. The QED tried </p>
<p>very hard to eliminate these leaks and bad connections, and even </p>
<p>sent two men to stand by at the cottage before and during the </p>
<p>eclipse, ready to dash off to search for a leak if one appeared. Mr. </p>
<p>Ashley reported that they thought the one that bothered us most was </p>
<p>in the house of our landlord, Dr. Ritchie. This menace was </p>
<p>eliminated by shutting off the doctor's electricity for six hours at </p>
<p>the most critical time.</p>
<p>I have said that we seldom felt that we could accept evening </p>
<p>invitations. This policy caused us some temporary embarrassment when </p>
<p>the static became so bad that we had to abandon our work. At such a </p>
<p>time there was almost nothing to do except to go to the movies, or </p>
<p>Bioscope, a name frequently abbreviated to "Bio". When drinking tea </p>
<p>during the "pouse" we were all too likely to meet acquaintances </p>
<p>whose invitations we had declined. I think, however, that our </p>
<p>explanations were accepted, especially by those who had visited the </p>
<p>cottage and seen how busy we were.</p>
<p>The Bioscope in Queenstown was a recognized way of entertaining </p>
<p>guests, apparently more popular than either bridge or the sundowner, </p>
<p>or sherry party. The movie theaters were generally unheated so, </p>
<p>until spring was well advanced, one dressed much as for a football </p>
<p>game in the United States. Once or twice Catherine was startled </p>
<p>when, telephoning to ask some couple to go to the Bio with us, her </p>
<p>potential guest would cheerily respond, "Oh, yes, we'd love to go. </p>
<p>Shall I bring rugs or will you?"</p>
<p>I am surprised, when looking at Catherine's log of our trip, to find </p>
<p>how often we went to the Bio and how many of the good old 193Os </p>
<p>movies we saw, ranging from "Gone with the Wind" to "The Mysterious </p>
<p>Mr. Moto". In fact, it was much like watching what we regard as the </p>
<p>best of television today! We became addicted to George Formby </p>
<p>movies. George was a music-hall-type comedian who spoke in a thick </p>
<p>Midlands accent (Lancashire, I think). His only disadvantage, for </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Leaks">Power Leaks / Life in Queenstown</b> </a>119</p>
<p>us, was that it took two or three movies before we could understand </p>
<p>most of what he said.</p>
<p>We were delighted with the birds we saw near the cottage. </p>
<p>Hammerkops, nearly as large but not as black as crows, were </p>
<p>frequently foraging for tadpoles in the stream when we crossed the </p>
<p>drift, and hoopoos with their handsome crowns were often seen in the </p>
<p>grass. The reeds and bushes along the stream were the habitat of </p>
<p>flocks of bishopbirds and weavers. We were fortunate enough not to </p>
<p>encounter any of the huge African porcupines that lived near the </p>
<p>cottage, but we sometimes picked up lost quills, as much as a foot </p>
<p>long and more than a quarter-inch in diameter.</p>
<p>A field behind the cottage contained a number of Dr. Ritchie's </p>
<p>cattle who had a watering trough with a wide concrete rim just on </p>
<p>the other side of a wire fence ten yards from our back door. On the </p>
<p>far side of the field was the hut of a family of natives. It was, we </p>
<p>were told, a little unusual for the head of the family to be the old </p>
<p>grandmother, who spoke no English. The family included five or six </p>
<p>children who were usually reinforced by several cousins or other </p>
<p>guests. The rim of the watering trough was a favorite playground for </p>
<p>this troop of pickaninnys, who ranged from a year and a half old to </p>
<p>perhaps ten or twelve. This was the best behaved group of children </p>
<p>we ever watched. There were no quarrels; the elders took good care </p>
<p>of the younger and helped amuse them; and we never heard a savage </p>
<p>word. We presently adopted the practice of putting leftovers from </p>
<p>tea, perhaps biscuits or fruit, or oddments such as empty wire reels </p>
<p>we thought the children would like, on the curb of the cattle </p>
<p>trough. To our amazement no child ever took any of these things for </p>
<p>himself; all were carefully taken home for the grandmother to </p>
<p>distribute as she saw fit. Whenever we left anything unusually </p>
<p>attractive, the children's mother or aunt would invariably appear to </p>
<p>ask if we really meant the donation for the children.</p>
<p>We always found this same consideration and absolute honesty among </p>
<p>the natives. One is inclined to suspect that because they had so </p>
<p>little it was the worst possible form to steal. We quickly adopted </p>
<p>the practice of leaving our doors unlocked and we never missed </p>
<p>sixpence from the change left on the bureau. We became very fond of </p>
<p>Maggie, our maid. Like any native woman, she put anything she had to </p>
<p>carry on top of her head. Occasionally we were in our room when </p>
<p>Maggie came to clean it. It was a great treat to watch her put the </p>
<p>pillows on her head, as the most convenient place, while she made </p>
<p>our beds.</p>
<p>Our tablewaiter, Martin van Heerden, was a treasure. He was half </p>
<p>Kaffir and half Chinese. In general we could never be sure which </p>
<p>side of his heritage would be uppermost, but there were exceptions. </p>
<p>It we complimented him upon a dessert, for example, (all foods </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Natives">The Natives</b> </a>120</p>
<p>except the meats and major vegetables were prepared by the waiters) </p>
<p>Martin would be all negro and covered by a happy grin. At the end of </p>
<p>the month, however, when we gave him his tip, he would be the </p>
<p>perfect suave and courteous Chinaman. Martin was, without doubt, the </p>
<p>best waiter we ever sat under. He had a perfect instinct for his </p>
<p>guests' desires. At the moment I realized that I would like a bit </p>
<p>more salt on a vegetable, I would find Martin handing it to me. If </p>
<p>we complimented him on, for example, a wonderful fresh pineapple </p>
<p>salad he made, he would accept the praise with pleasure, If, on </p>
<p>another occasion, we again spoke well of the same thing, Martin </p>
<p>would realize that we truly liked it. From then on that salad would </p>
<p>appear on the table at exactly the right intervals. He never overdid </p>
<p>it, but somehow just on the day when we would come into the </p>
<p>diningroom saying, I wish Martin would have that fine salad again, </p>
<p>we would find it there on the table.</p>
<p>One of the things that was never done in South Africa was to carry a </p>
<p>parcel. When we were shopping on foot, the storekeeper would wrap up </p>
<p>our purchase and thank us effusively for our custom. He would then </p>
<p>call from the back room a native man and hand him the package, even </p>
<p>If it were no larger than a toothbrush. The native would follow us </p>
<p>patiently through the rest of our shopping until we reached the </p>
<p>hotel, when he would hand the parcel to the hall porter. </p>
<p>Occasionally we would get to the hotel followed by a retinue of six </p>
<p>or eight blacks, each with our purchases from a different shop.</p>
<p>On two occasions when I was driving to Grahamstown on errands, and </p>
<p>unfortunately when Catherine was not with me, I saw remarkable </p>
<p>sights in the realm of natural history. One was a tremendous male </p>
<p>ostrich which I estimated as eight feet tall. He had perfect jet </p>
<p>black feathers and, of course, great whiteplumed wings. His legs </p>
<p>were a highly varnished golden orange and his thighs were as thick </p>
<p>as those of a big man. I had had no idea that an ostrich could be </p>
<p>such a large and handsome creature. When he presently left the road </p>
<p>and wandered off through an orchard of fruit trees, his head stuck </p>
<p>up a foot or more above the foliage. On the second occasion I was </p>
<p>treated to the greatest feat of strength I ever saw. Driving around </p>
<p>a curve, I came upon a large baboon in the road and stopped the car </p>
<p>twenty or thirty feet away to watch him. After we had looked at one </p>
<p>another for a minute or two, he started to leave the road which was </p>
<p>bordered by a wire fence. The baboon reached up to grasp the top of </p>
<p>a fivefoot fence post. After a look at the car, and without the </p>
<p>slightest sign of a jump, he simply lifted himself with one arm in a </p>
<p>large arc that deposited him gently on the far side of the fence. </p>
<p>Then, at complete leisure, he wandered off into the veld.</p>
<p>The stream at the cottage caused us a minor amount of trouble; or </p>
<p>rather the slopes down to and up from the drift did so. These turned </p>
<p>out to be extremely slippery when wet, and the first few seconds of </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Erosion">Erosion</a></b> 121</p>
<p>rain made it almost impossible for the car to climb up the little </p>
<p>slopes that rose three or four feet in fifteen or twenty. The first </p>
<p>time I slid off one of these slopes and got stuck, I hitched a ride </p>
<p>to town and got the garage (from which we had rented the 1937 </p>
<p>Chevrolet) to send a truck to pull it out. This they did very neatly </p>
<p>but took about four hours to do so because South Africans seldom </p>
<p>recognized any reason to hurry. On another occasion I found a pair </p>
<p>of oxen to pull me out. After these experiences we learned to keep </p>
<p>an eye on the sky when we were at the cottage and to get the car to </p>
<p>the other side of the drift whenever we saw a dark cloud. Often, as </p>
<p>the rains became more frequent, we left the oar on the road side of </p>
<p>the drift and waded the stream. At times the rain was heavy enough </p>
<p>so that the stream rose rapidly and made crossing very difficult.</p>
<p>The ocasionally-muddy banks of the stream were a symptom of a wide-</p>
<p>spread problem in South Africa: erosion. Apparently a large fraction </p>
<p>of the rainfall, although sparse in some areas, came in the form of </p>
<p>thunderstorms. Many of these brought heavy rain. As a result, even </p>
<p>the ant-hills that were often six or eight feet tall were usually </p>
<p>eroded in irregular and often interesting patterns. The same was </p>
<p>true of any river embankment or other place where the inclination of </p>
<p>the land was at all steep. I often wondered about the lifetime of a </p>
<p>farm, because there was ample evidence that most of them were </p>
<p>gradually being washed away.</p>
<p>All but a few of the largest streams and rivers tended to be dry </p>
<p>except for occasional floods after a storm. When there was water in </p>
<p>them, it was sure to be chocolate brown in color. This was a great </p>
<p>surprise to me, as I had never before been in a region where running </p>
<p>water was not clear. Even in Kazakhstan, on the hungry steppe, the </p>
<p>only available river looked quite blue because the land was very </p>
<p>flat and there was little current in the stream.</p>
<p>The ease with which South African land could be torn away was shown </p>
<p>clearly in one of our movies of a man plowing with a span of oxen. </p>
<p>Even at the stately pace of the beasts, the plow stirred up a cloud </p>
<p>of dust that carried fully two hundred yards downwind, even though </p>
<p>the breeze was so slight that we had not noticed it.</p>
<p>The normally dry streams were crossed by drifts rather than bridges. </p>
<p>Some of the more elegant, or more travelled, drifts were paved with </p>
<p>two concrete tracks, each perhaps a foot and a half wide, raised a </p>
<p>foot or two above the bed of the river. These at least guaranteed a </p>
<p>smooth "road" for a car, but I wondered if anyone could keep his </p>
<p>wheels on the two strips if they were covered with muddy water.</p>
<p>Much about South African roads was implied by the use of "all-</p>
<p>weather" as an adjective describing some of them. It is </p>
<p>understandable that a country of half a million square miles with a </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erosion 122</p>
<p>non-native population of only two million would have difficulty in </p>
<p>financing an adequate road system. The best routes, such as the </p>
<p>forty miles between Jo'burg and Pretoria, were excellent by any </p>
<p>standard, but many metalled roads were only water-bound macadam and </p>
<p>were heavily washboarded in most cases. The popular automobile when </p>
<p>we were there was the biggest Chrysler because it would stand up to </p>
<p>the work. It was customary to drive at seventy to ninety miles per </p>
<p>hour, but I never really decided whether this was believed to be </p>
<p>more comfortable or because it got the agony finished quickly. </p>
<p>Whatever the hypothesis, light cars, like the Chevrolet we rented, </p>
<p>had a limited lifetime.</p>
<p>The same necessary economy was evident in the bridges. In the </p>
<p>mountainous parts of the country, the roads naturally followed </p>
<p>beside the beds of streams. It was equally natural that these were </p>
<p>the regions that often required bridges rather than drifts. For </p>
<p>minimum cost, these were built exactly at right angles to the </p>
<p>streams. As a result, when one's road crossed from one side of the </p>
<p>river to the other, there was a tight ninety degree turn to be </p>
<p>negotiated at each end of the bridge. These curves could not </p>
<p>possibly be passed at a speed greater than ten or fifteen miles per </p>
<p>hour. This was especially true of roads that had not recently been </p>
<p>repaired. The tight curves on these had a strong tendency to have </p>
<p>worn into the wrong kind of crown, with the outside of the curve </p>
<p>lower than the inside, and also to be covered with loose gravel. One </p>
<p>quickly learned the habit of slowing nearly to a stop when a bridge </p>
<p>was seen ahead, so that its approaches could be negotiated with </p>
<p>great caution.</p>
<p>A span of oxen, as mentioned above, is a harnessed team of eight </p>
<p>pairs, usually pulling a large wagon, but at times drawing a plow or </p>
<p>some other device. To "inspan" is to harness the animals to the </p>
<p>wagon and to "outspan" is to unharness them. Hence "outspan" comes </p>
<p>to mean to make camp, as on the Great Trek when the Dutch settlers </p>
<p>retreated to the Transvaal after the Cape Province had been </p>
<p>conquered by the British. Spans of oxen were still occasionally to </p>
<p>be seen in 1940. The major streets in most towns, including </p>
<p>Queenstown, were originally laid cut wide enough so that a span of </p>
<p>oxen and the wagon could make a U-turn in the street - an excellent </p>
<p>heritage for later generations.</p>
<p>In early September we received a letter that intrigued and puzzled </p>
<p>us. It came from a Miss Soga, a black teacher in the native </p>
<p>compound. Miss Soga claimed to be the only native woman who had ever </p>
<p>visited the United States. She was anxious to talk to us but could </p>
<p>not, of course, call at our hotel. We finally arranged for her to </p>
<p>come to the cottage for tea, to the great embarassment of our South </p>
<p>African boys, and we found her very interesting. She was a sixth </p>
<p>grade teacher and active in the church. She had been sent to some </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erosion 123</p>
<p>sort of Sunday school conference in India, where she had attracted </p>
<p>the attention of religious leaders from the United States who had </p>
<p>arranged for her to continue around the world on her way home. Miss </p>
<p>Soga came to tea two or three times, and it was from her that we </p>
<p>learned most of what little we came to know about native life. She </p>
<p>ultimately extracted a promise that I would come to the reservation </p>
<p>and talk to the natives. It was not possible to arrange this before </p>
<p>November, but it was to be a most memorable occasion.</p>
<p>From Miss Soga and others we learned that the standard wage for a </p>
<p>field hand was ten shillings a month and that a well trained cook or </p>
<p>butler could command a pound a month with, of course, board supplied </p>
<p>in both cases. It seemed hard to us that a family was taxed a </p>
<p>shilling a month for each child in school. We found that the natives </p>
<p>supported each other to a remarkable degree. A black man tramping </p>
<p>across country, perhaps in search of a job, would stop at night at </p>
<p>any cabin he came to. The family would always take him in and share </p>
<p>what little they had with him. We were at last able to understand </p>
<p>why the servants at the hotel were so grateful for the shillings we </p>
<p>divided amongst them. It was also easy to see why the English people </p>
<p>felt no need to do anything for themselves. The Afrikaners, or </p>
<p>Boers, on the other hand, did work hard but had many of the </p>
<p>characteristics of "poor whites" in the United States. The English </p>
<p>in South Africa seemed to us to be primarily interested in </p>
<p>exploiting the country to their own benefit. They expected to send </p>
<p>their children to England for schooling and to retire there </p>
<p>themselves if and when they became rich enough. It was a source of </p>
<p>irritation to them that they did not often prosper as well as </p>
<p>"foreigners" such as Hollanders or Americans. We were kind enough </p>
<p>not to call to their attention the obvious fact that their rewards </p>
<p>were generally proportional to the energy they put into their </p>
<p>enterprises. We came to rather prefer the Afrikaans settlers as far </p>
<p>as we happened to meet them, because they at least actually lived in </p>
<p>the country and expected their children to continue to do so. They </p>
<p>tended to be poorly educated religious fundamentalists, but they </p>
<p>expected no more from the country than they were prepared to put </p>
<p>into it. Sadly, we were unable to decide which group treated the </p>
<p>natives the more brutally.</p>
<p>At the time we were there, the English and Afrikaans political </p>
<p>parties were almost equally strong. The best proof is that they </p>
<p>voted to enter World War II by a very narrow margin in Parliament. A </p>
<p>result of this balance of forces was that progress was difficult to </p>
<p>achieve. If an Englishman, say, proposed a program of highway </p>
<p>improvement, it was only to be expected that a few English would be </p>
<p>opposed to it for some reason, while the Afrikaners would all vote </p>
<p>against it because the project had been suggested by an Englishman. </p>
<p>The standard vote in Parliament was, therefore, No.</p>

<p>Although towns and larger districts tended to be almost pure English </p>
<p>or Afrikaans, in theory everyone could speak both languages. Local </p>
<p>pride, however, was such that it was often impossible for us to get </p>
<p>a question answered in an Afrikaans region until we explained that </p>
<p>we were Americans and did not understand that language. The surly, </p>
<p>bearded Afrikaner who had previously refused to understand English </p>
<p>would then be overcome with courtesy and would often invite us in </p>
<p>for refreshments.</p>
<p>It was a rule that both languages had to be displayed equally. For </p>
<p>example, the two tongues would be used for alternate stamps in a </p>
<p>sheet. Our mail would arrive marked in both ways: Opened by Censors </p>
<p>and "Deur Censeur Oopgemacht. A street sign or traffic warning would </p>
<p>be double with one language above the other; the other side of the </p>
<p>sign would invariably have the order of languages reversed. We </p>
<p>sometimes felt it a little unnecessary to have a sign saying School </p>
<p>also carry the warning "Skool", but occasionally the Afrlkaans signs </p>
<p>gave us great pleasure, particularly the one balancing "No Honking", </p>
<p>which said, "Geen Gehouten: and became rather a slogan with us.</p>
<p>The Afrikaans language has been described to us as a kitchen Dutch </p>
<p>modified by French because there had been a considerable Huguenot </p>
<p>immigration into South Africa. We vaguely understood this </p>
<p>philological history, but were surprised to have two or three </p>
<p>veterans of World War I tell us that they had been able to make </p>
<p>themselves understood in Flanders. Apparently the two parent </p>
<p>languages had rubbed together in much the same proportions in these </p>
<p>two widely-separated places, and had developed in somewhat the same </p>
<p>way.</p>

<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Afrikaans">The Afrikaans Language / The Eclipse </a></p>
</b><p>Eclipse day finally arrived, as we had known it would, and by good </p>
<p>luck and hard work we were ready with everything behaving well. Here </p>
<p>I would quote Catherine's log description of this period except that </p>
<p>somehow it sounds as though I were hardly present, while my </p>
<p>recollection tells me that I was fully occupied. We had scheduled </p>
<p>and rehearsed the operation thoroughly. There were five assistants </p>
<p>besides Catherine available that day, so that we were able to give </p>
<p>each of them at least half the time during the eclipse to enjoy the </p>
<p>sight. I spent the time from four AM until eleven checking a </p>
<p>thousand things and then settled down to the operating position, as </p>
<p>I felt that I could run the machinery faster than anyone else, and </p>
<p>did not want any of the boys to feel badly if everything were not </p>
<p>done well. The assistants at the various positions changed </p>
<p>frequently, while Catherine prepared for and made visual </p>
<p>observations, such as the times of contacts and the times when </p>
<p>sunspots or visible faculae were occulted and reappeared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Afrikaans Language / The Eclipse 125</p>
<p>At 4:O1:3O P.M., I abandoned the radio observations long enough to </p>
<p>dash out the back door of the cottage and take a quick look at the </p>
<p>corona. The records showed that I was absent from the operating </p>
<p>position for twelve seconds. From seven to eight P.M. I was </p>
<p>relieved, and then went back to operating except for a short break </p>
<p>at one AM, when I drove Catherine to the hotel and then returned to </p>
<p>work. At five in the morning of October second I was relieved and </p>
<p>went to bed. Although I got up for dinner, I wasn't worth much for </p>
<p>the rest of the day and ended by going to the movies in the evening, </p>
<p>because I was too tense to get to sleep again. One of the most </p>
<p>interesting features of our schedule was the meticulous planning for </p>
<p>the use of the one car, involving which of us should drive it back </p>
<p>and forth to the hotel in order to have the right people on and off </p>
<p>duty.</p>
<p>The results of the expedition were first reported in a letter to </p>
<p>Nature written jointly with A. J. Higgs from Australia and Eric </p>
<p>Halliday from Johannesburg (both of whom were making somewhat allied </p>
<p>observations in other towns in the eclipse track), as a result of a </p>
<p>meeting a few days after the eclipse. My real paper was written in </p>
<p>the months following our return to the United States. Unfortunately, </p>
<p>I was then swept up for defense work, and the paper was not </p>
<p>submitted for publication until 1946. It was one of several of my </p>
<p>papers that was, so far as I can prove, never read by anyone! The </p>
<p>results amply and prettily confirmed the 1936 data. Of more </p>
<p>interest, at least in retrospect, was my discovery that the rate at </p>
<p>which the ionization changed could only be explained on the theory </p>
<p>that the ionizing energy came primarily from the perimeter of the </p>
<p>sun and not uniformly from the whole disc. As I just implied, this </p>
<p>suggestion attracted no interest. I was greatly pleased, however, </p>
<p>when, in the l95Os, the Naval Research Laboratory finally got an X-</p>
<p>ray rocket photograph of the sun which showed a ring of bright </p>
<p>radiation around the edge and a relatively dark center.</p>

<p>In Capetown we had first discovered traces of a misconception that </p>
<p>was to cause me a good deal of embarrasment. It was begun, I </p>
<p>suspect, by Sturrock's Ltd., the shipping agents who took care of </p>
<p>our equipment and reservations. Whatever the source, I was to find </p>
<p>that, wherever we went, we were preceded by the rumor that I vas </p>
<p>"Professor Pierce of Harvard University", which was untrue by a wide </p>
<p>margin. My title at the time was Supervisor of Field Activities in </p>
<p>Physics and Communications Engineering; which should be interpreted </p>
<p>in terms of the academic rule that the more important the position </p>
<p>the shorter the title. In the United States this error would not </p>
<p>have been of much consequence as people of my age were often at </p>
<p>least Assistant Professors. South Africa however, operated </p>
<p>essentially under the British system where "The Professor" was </p>
<p>equivalent to the Chairman of the Department and all lower forms of </p>
<p>life were lecturers or wranglers or something else I never </p>
<p>understood.</p>
<p>Dr. Jackson at the Royal Observatory bad been the first to display </p>
<p>shock at meeting us. He had kindly invited us to dinner, as </p>
<p>mentioned above, when Professor James had been stricken by the </p>
<p>Influenza bug. Dr. Jackson had obviously been dismayed at our youth </p>
<p>and exhibited his reaction in a couple of interesting ways. When </p>
<p>having us sign the Observatory guest book, he, after a moment's </p>
<p>thought, turned the page so that we did not profane the sheet </p>
<p>containing the signatures of a titled couple, who bad been recent </p>
<p>visitors. He had driven to the hotel to pick us up for dinner but, </p>
<p>after assaying our importance, he contented himself by returning us </p>
<p>to the Observatory railway station and informing us that the fare to </p>
<p>Capetown would be fourpence. Similar reactions were encountered from </p>
<p>time to time, because I found it totally impossible to tell who </p>
<p>might have encountered my undeserved reputation and I could not </p>
<p>often find a way of disclaiming it in advance. This problem was not </p>
<p>serious in Queenstown, where we stayed long enough to let the </p>
<p>citizens form an accurate assessment of us, but it did disturb me </p>
<p>considerably when we visited the larger cities later on.</p>
<p>There were, of course, occasions when I was reminded of my true </p>
<p>position and prevented from believing too much in my own importance. </p>
<p>One or two of them were telephone calls from people who had, in </p>
<p>earlier years been students of Professor G.W. Pierce and who were </p>
<p>naturally eager to greet him. The final factor in constraining my </p>
<p>modesty was when a new friend who lived at the Hexagon Hotel gave a </p>
<p>sundowner to introduce us to the couple who published the local </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>newspaper. I was properly put in my place to discover that the </p>
<p>questions they most wished to have answered were whether it was true </p>
<p>that Catherine was also a scientist and also, in that case, if she </p>
<p>actually knew more than I did. Fortunately for my mental balance, </p>
<p>the answers in both cases were in the affirmative.</p>
<p>Because we were anxious to visit Kruger Park, one of the earliest </p>
<p>and best of the wild animal refuges in Africa, we modified our </p>
<p>schedule to some extent. The lowland areas of the park were due to </p>
<p>be closed at the end of October because of the threat of malaria </p>
<p>after the rainy season began. We therefore decided to suspend </p>
<p>operation, except for what Bob Verwoerd could do by himself, for the </p>
<p>last week in October and the first in November, and to continue </p>
<p>gathering background data for the rest of November if I could get </p>
<p>the authorizations to use our equipment extended. After dickering </p>
<p>for new tires for the rented Chevy, which had been having flats once </p>
<p>a week or even more often, we left Queenstown for the park on </p>
<p>October 23rd, with only a brief stop at the American Legation in </p>
<p>Pretoria to set the license extension machinery in motion. There, we </p>
<p>encountered our first real "careless talk costs lives" campaign, as </p>
<p>we could find no one to tell us where to find the Legation. After </p>
<p>many tries, the Post Office gave us the address in a suburb but </p>
<p>refused to tell us how to get there. In the end I had to telephone </p>
<p>the Legation and get our directions from them.</p>
<p>We had planned for weeks to stay at the Hotel Victoria in Jo'Burg, </p>
<p>as people in Queenstown had assured us that that was the only place </p>
<p>in the Union where American cocktails could be had. Our first </p>
<p>attempt was a sad failure as we had planned to order Manhattans. </p>
<p>Something of the sort arrived, but turned out to have been made with </p>
<p>Scotch whisky and garnished with a candied cherry. After a time, </p>
<p>probably on our return from Kruger Park, we found that a "Tom </p>
<p>Collins" in South Afrioa is a distant cousin of a Rum Collins. By </p>
<p>insisting on its mixture by American standards and having it served </p>
<p>with ice instead of at room temperature, we round it a creditable </p>
<p>drink even though they persisted in serving it in a mug.</p>
<p>We were told that Kruger Park was formed in about 1890, soon after </p>
<p>"Oom Paul" Kruger had won the temporary independence of the Republic </p>
<p>of the Transvaal. The Boers were farsighted enough to fence off an </p>
<p>immense area enclosing a part of the high veld and extending down </p>
<p>into the lowlands on the border of Mozambique. This area has been </p>
<p>left undisturbed except for a network of dirt roads and the </p>
<p>construction of a number of rest camps, well fenced to keep the </p>
<p>animals out. One can drive freely in the Park, from before sunrise </p>
<p>until after sunset, but is fined if caught outside the car. It </p>
<p>turned out that the lowland area had been closed two weeks early </p>
<p>that year, so we were only able to visit the Pretorius Kop camp, </p>
<p>which is the nearest to Jo'burg and Pretoria. We were thus unable to </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="trip">A Vacation Trip </a>128</p>
<p>go to the regions where we would have seen elephants and rhinos, but </p>
<p>we had a delightful time anyway. We found that we did not seriously </p>
<p>miss seeing the "ordinary" circus and zoo animals, while there were </p>
<p>many antelope and buck species with which we were not familiar and a </p>
<p>tremendous variety of large and small birds we knew nothing about.</p>
<p>At Pretorius Kop the cabins were thatched concrete imitations of </p>
<p>circular native huts (rondavels), with simple but relatively </p>
<p>comfortable furnishings. The huts were disposed around an area in </p>
<p>which a group of natives kept fires burning, to cook any food </p>
<p>visitors cared to bring with them and, of course, to provide hot </p>
<p>water for tea at any hour. A native was attached to each rondavel to </p>
<p>make beds or cook as required and to wake the visitors with morning </p>
<p>tea. We found that the best plan was to have tea at 7:30 A.M. and </p>
<p>eat a few biscuits so that we could get out as soon as the gate was </p>
<p>opened. We would then cruise slowly around, seeing what chance </p>
<p>brought us, until perhaps nine o'clock when we would return to </p>
<p>breakfast at the restaurant that had recently been opened. We would </p>
<p>rest and read and write through the middle of the day, when the </p>
<p>sightseeing was not as rewarding, and get out into the roads for </p>
<p>another three hours or more as the light began to fade. At night we </p>
<p>learned to sleep in spite of the serenade by lions, hyenas, and </p>
<p>other nameless creatures, enjoying the thought of the sturdy ten-</p>
<p>foot fence around the camp.</p>
<p>Among the many animals we saw, we became especially fond of two. The </p>
<p>little steenbok, about the size of newborn New England fawns with </p>
<p>tiny two-inch horns, were a continual delight. They always appeared </p>
<p>in pairs a few feet apart and displayed both timidity and great </p>
<p>curiosity. When we disturbed a pair near the road they would dash </p>
<p>away at high speed for thirty or forty feet and then suddenly stop </p>
<p>to look back to see what we were doing. A move of the car or a touch </p>
<p>on the "hooter" would send them into another dash followed by a </p>
<p>stiff-legged stop for another look.</p>
<p>The wild wart-hogs differed greatly from any we had seen in zoos. </p>
<p>They were just as ugly in front, but adorned by tails with debonair </p>
<p>tassels. When disturbed, they would trot off into the brush carrying </p>
<p>their tails straight up with the plumes weaving gaily from side to </p>
<p>side. In zoos, even In Jo'burg, we never saw them with anything but </p>
<p>bedraggled rat-like tails that always trailed limply behind them.</p>
<p>There was a hippo pool but at the times we visited it the conditions </p>
<p>were not right for any of them to be out on the bank. We had a fine </p>
<p>time, however, watching them in the water, enjoying the way the </p>
<p>mother timed her risings to breathe to the shorter span of her baby. </p>
<p>We greatly admired the rotary twist with which they cleared the </p>
<p>water from their ears, producing little splashes in an almost </p>
<p>perfect circle nearly a yard in diameter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="kop">At Pretorius Kop</b> </a>129</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had hard luck trying to see a lion, which greatly disturbed the </p>
<p>staff at the rest camp. We had to suspect that many visitors came </p>
<p>primarily to see lions and felt their trips wasted if they failed to </p>
<p>see some. As I have said, we were far more interested in the species </p>
<p>that were new to us. Fortunately, on our last morning, we were able </p>
<p>to satisfy our friends, at least with the sight of a lioness. She </p>
<p>had been lying behind a patch of brush near the road watching for </p>
<p>her breakfast, one of a herd of zebra, to drift within range. Our </p>
<p>car disturbed the zebra which moved away. This brought the lioness </p>
<p>to her feet, with a fine snarl in our direction, and she started </p>
<p>away across the veld. I knew that there was another road within a </p>
<p>half a mile in the direction she was taking, so I turned the car and </p>
<p>drove to a point when I thought she might appear. Right on schedule, </p>
<p>she came out of the brush a hundred yards away. I moved the car </p>
<p>forward once or twice, stopping in between to take movies of the </p>
<p>lioness, and finally getting into a position exactly in her path. </p>
<p>She came within six or eight yards before, with another snarl she </p>
<p>condescended to alter her path a little to pass directly in front of </p>
<p>the car. Catherine says that the lioness brushed the radiator with </p>
<p>her whiskers, while I maintain that she lashed her tail against the </p>
<p>bumper. Certainly, she was very close. After passing us, she </p>
<p>distinctly turned again into the exact track she had been following, </p>
<p>before we got in her way, and strolled out of sight.</p>
<p>On our return from Kruger Park we decided to stay at the Victoria in </p>
<p>Jo'burg again (the quality of their cocktails notwithstanding) </p>
<p>partly because we had not cared for the hotel in Pretoria and partly </p>
<p>because the Victoria was one of the few hotels where we did not have </p>
<p>to pay for meals we did not eat. Our first full day, however, we </p>
<p>spent in Pretoria starting at the American Legation. My license </p>
<p>extensions had been granted with no difficulty. I had been impressed </p>
<p>by the difference in the ionospheric behavior in at least our part </p>
<p>of the southern hemisphere and had a half-formed idea, as our money </p>
<p>was lasting much better than I had dared expect, of staying another </p>
<p>six months to gather data on seasonal variations. I pressed Mr. </p>
<p>Keena, the Minister, for an opinion about the wisdom of doing this, </p>
<p>but found him to be the perfect diplomat, full of information but </p>
<p>with no quotable judgments. It has interested me since to realize </p>
<p>how clearly he foresaw trouble with Japan. He spoke of the </p>
<p>increasing pressure for passages from the Far East to America via </p>
<p>Capetown, and allowed us to conclude that since we had valid </p>
<p>reservations on a ship we would do well to use them.</p>
<p>Both before and after visiting Kruger Park, we found Pretoria </p>
<p>enjoying the height of the blooming season of the Jacaranda trees </p>
<p>that lined most of the streets. The view looking back at the city </p>
<p>from the terrace of the suburban Union Buildings was particularly </p>
<p>entrancing. The entire city seemed immersed in a beautiful blue haze </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="joburg">Johannesburg</a></b> 130</p>
<p>of Jacaranda blossoms.</p>
<p>We spent an afternoon at the Natural History Museum In Pretoria </p>
<p>identifying many of the unfamiliar animals and birds we had seen in </p>
<p>the Park and elsewhere. I was especially impressed by the size of a </p>
<p>mounted giraffe that had a chest whose girth would do credit to most </p>
<p>circus elephants. He was so large that Catherine could stand under </p>
<p>his belly. I used her known height for a reference and deduced his </p>
<p>height to be seventeen and a half feet.</p>
<p>The following day, November first, was a memorable one. Doctor </p>
<p>Schonland had pulled strings to get us into a gold mine, although </p>
<p>the war had nominally stopped such visits, and in return had asked </p>
<p>me to give a lecture at the University. It happened that both of </p>
<p>these functions came on the same day. A Lieutenant assistant to </p>
<p>Major Schonland (who was then in uniform but still directing the </p>
<p>Bernard Price Institute of Geophysics) came to the hotel early to </p>
<p>take us to the mine. After showing us how safe everything was and </p>
<p>making us sign legal releases, we were bundled into blue jeans and </p>
<p>foul weather gear because the humidity in the mine was so high that </p>
<p>it rained in the shafts and through the open cage in which we </p>
<p>descended.</p>
<p>The hoisting machinery at the pit-head centered on a drum at least </p>
<p>thirty feet in diameter that rolled up a 4,000-foot cable with a car </p>
<p>at the end. The loads to be carried and the strength of steel cable </p>
<p>were such that the descent had to be limited to 4,000 feet at a </p>
<p>time. The mine was then working at various levels down to 10,000 </p>
<p>feet below the surface. It would take visitors only to the 6,000 </p>
<p>foot level because at greater depths the temperature could not be </p>
<p>kept below 130 degrees Fahrenheit. Even at 6,000 feet, with the </p>
<p>temperature at 110 degrees and the humidity at 100 percent, we found </p>
<p>it easy to believe that only natives with unusual endurance could do </p>
<p>useful work.</p>
<p>The mine manager was kind enough to instruct the lift operator that </p>
<p>visitors were going down so that he limited the speed of our descent </p>
<p>to 2,250 feet per minute. Even so, it was quite an experience as we </p>
<p>dropped thousands of feet in total darkness. At the 4,000-foot level </p>
<p>we found the nucleus of a small city. It had, of course, been </p>
<p>necessary to dig a "cave" that would at least accomodate another </p>
<p>complete set of hoisting machinery to serve the next 4,000 feet. </p>
<p>There was also an electric sub-station, heavy pumps to drive down </p>
<p>the air needed at lower levels, a carpenter shop for preparing </p>
<p>timbers for bracing the tunnels, a small hospital and various other </p>
<p>attributes of civilization.</p>
<p>Another 2,000-foot drop brought us to a working level where we were </p>
<p>provided with natives to carry lights for us as we walked through </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="gold">The Gold Mine</b> </a>131</p>
<p>various tunnels and watched the native miners hacking, away at the </p>
<p>rather thin sheet of gold-bearing rock. Our guides picked up samples </p>
<p>of the ore for our souvenirs.</p>
<p>Back at the surface, where even the relatively hot day seemed cool </p>
<p>and delightful, we were shown the processing operations. After </p>
<p>grinding the rock nearly as fine as face powder, part of the gold </p>
<p>was removed mechanically, and the rest dissolved out by a cyanide </p>
<p>process. The gold in solution in the large holding tanks was a </p>
<p>beautiful greenish aquamarine in color. This mine smelted only once </p>
<p>a month so we could not see that part of the operation. We were, </p>
<p>however, taken to the vault and shown a number of gold ingots. These </p>
<p>were 1000-ounce bars, a little smaller than ordinary bread tins. </p>
<p>Since a thousand ounces is nearly seventy pounds, it was only upon </p>
<p>about the third try that we were able to pick up such a concentrated </p>
<p>weight.</p>
<p>One difficulty with gold mining is that after treating a ton of ore </p>
<p>there is still a ton of rock powder left over. In Jo'burg these </p>
<p>immense accumulations are simply piled in the most convenient </p>
<p>places, so that the city has a horizon of large mine dumps, as much </p>
<p>as 200 feet high. They come in various shades of gray, yellow, and </p>
<p>brown, and are visually rather attractive. Unfortunately, dust blows </p>
<p>from them all too easily, in spite of regulations for fixing the </p>
<p>surface with cement powder, or other varnish, Jo'burg thus tends to </p>
<p>be a dusty city and, at least when we were there, few white clothes </p>
<p>were to be seen.</p>
<p>The economies of South African gold mining were startling to us. We </p>
<p>were told that the industry's average yield was seven and three-</p>
<p>fourths pennyweight of gold per ton of rock, or between eight and </p>
<p>nine dollars' worth at the 1940 price of $35.00 per ounce. It was </p>
<p>obvious that such poor ore could be mined at so great a depth only </p>
<p>where very cheap labor could be found. Mining gold was supposed to </p>
<p>be the finest job a native could have as he was paid two shillings </p>
<p>per day. The natives were obtained by recruiting parties who </p>
<p>searched for and selected those strong enough for the work. They </p>
<p>were engaged for six-month contracts and were confined in compounds </p>
<p>when not down in the mines. In addition to this pay, the companies </p>
<p>spent about a shilling a day per man for housing and feeding the </p>
<p>laborers. We were told that after six months as a miner a native </p>
<p>could go home and support his family for a year and a half or two </p>
<p>years on his accumulated wages. Some were reputed to be strong </p>
<p>enough to reenlist after a while but, in general, the recruiters </p>
<p>were having to range more and more widely, to find men.</p>
<p>We were shown graphs of the yield of the gold mines over the years, </p>
<p>As the richer and more accessible ores had become exhausted, the </p>
<p>profits had dwindled to substantially zero in 1933, when the United </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gold Mine 132</p>
<p>States gave them a new and large profit by raising the price of gold </p>
<p>from twenty to thirty-five dollars per ounce. Unless the economics </p>
<p>of South African gold mining have changed radically, the present </p>
<p>price of three hundred dollars per ounce must have made operations </p>
<p>very profitable indeed.</p>
<p>After Major Schonland's Lieutenant had returned us to the hotel and </p>
<p>stayed to lunch with us, we embarked on a series of afternoon calls, </p>
<p>primarily at the Union Observatory and the Yale Observatory. While </p>
<p>in the mine in the morning Catherine had twisted an ankle that </p>
<p>continued to bother her, and we returned early to the hotel so that </p>
<p>she could soak her foot before our evening engagements. It was </p>
<p>fortunate that we had plenty of time because it took an hour or more </p>
<p>of waiting to get the use of the electric iron to press Catherine's </p>
<p>evening dress. I made the disturbing discovery that I had left my </p>
<p>cuff links in Queenstown. The hall porter, who had produced epsom </p>
<p>salts to treat Catherine's ankle, dashed out and bought me the only </p>
<p>cheap set he could find quickly. They were impossibly loud, having </p>
<p>alternate stripes of red and blue enamel. It happened that the </p>
<p>opposite side of the links consisted of relatively large gold-</p>
<p>colored knobs, so I simply wore the links backward and hoped for the </p>
<p>best. </p>
<p>Before my lecture we were to dine with Principal Haikes, the Vice-</p>
<p>Chancellor (or president) of the University of the Witwatersrand and </p>
<p>his wife. The other guests were Dr. and Mrs. Schonland and Mr. and </p>
<p>Mrs. Bernard Price. Mr. Price was a gold-mining millionaire who had </p>
<p>endowed the Institute of Geophysics and, presumably Dr. Schonland's </p>
<p>position as its Director. The dinner was served with a maximum of </p>
<p>British form, having gloved black footmen with spectacular liveries </p>
<p>as waiters. It was certainly the best dinner we had in South Africa </p>
<p>even though it had to be hurried a little to get us to the lecture </p>
<p>well in time. Catherine was, I think, most impressed by Mrs. Price's </p>
<p>lovely Maribou stole, while I enjoyed finding that we were eating at </p>
<p>least one course from gold plates.</p>
<p>At the lecture Principal Haikes produced a remarkable performance. </p>
<p>He introduced me rather extravagantly and then sat down in the front </p>
<p>row and quietly went to sleep. He continued to sleep comfortably </p>
<p>until about thirty seconds before I finished when, without any </p>
<p>signal from his wife that I could see, he awoke and returned to the </p>
<p>platform to say all of the correct things. Even though I knew that </p>
<p>he must have been well briefed by Dr. Schonland, he almost convinced </p>
<p>me that he had not missed a word of my lecture. After a small party </p>
<p>at the Schonlands' we were at last allowed to end the busiest day we </p>
<p>had had since the eclipse.</p>
<p>The next day we visited the National Museum where we were especially </p>
<p>thrilled to see the stone cross originally erected on the southern </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="diaz">Dinner and Lecture / The Cross of Diaz</b> </a>133</p>
<p>coast of Africa by Bartolomeo Diaz. After a clever bit of </p>
<p>archeological research, the broken fragments of this cross had only </p>
<p>recently been found and put together again.</p>
<p>Catherine, being full of energy, then went on with Mrs. Schonland to </p>
<p>meet Mrs. Pratt-Nichols, whom we might call the chief women's </p>
<p>housemother at the University, while I went back to the hotel to </p>
<p>rest a headache. Catherine learned a lot about the place of women in </p>
<p>South African college life, of which I chiefly remember the very </p>
<p>limited variety of available courses and the practical impossibility </p>
<p>of changing a major field after matriculation.</p>
<p>We started back to Queenstown by way of Bloemfontein, primarily to </p>
<p>pay calls at observatories. We were welcomed at her home by Mrs. </p>
<p>Rossiter who showed us how to find the Michigan Observatory where </p>
<p>her husband was working alone. We were mutually pleased to learn </p>
<p>that she expected to sail for the United States on the same ship we </p>
<p>were to take in December. My chief recollection of the observatory </p>
<p>was that the main telescope had about the proportions of a walking-</p>
<p>stick - excellent, Catherine assured me, for the study of double </p>
<p>stars on which Doctor Rossiter did most of his research.</p>
<p>The Harvard Southern Station at Harvard Kopje (pronounced "copy" and </p>
<p>meaning small hill) was some miles away from Bloemfontein, in </p>
<p>Hazelspoort. Here Dr. Paraskevopoulos, who was always called "Doctor </p>
<p>Paras", had had an opportunity that was rare before 1940. He had </p>
<p>directed the southern station in Peru before Harvard had decided to </p>
<p>give up that location and move its southern observations to South </p>
<p>Africa. He therefore had the chance to start anew instead of working </p>
<p>with the equipment left by previous generations of astronomers, as </p>
<p>had been necessary in most observatories. Dr. Paras was able to </p>
<p>select what he wanted from Peru, Cambridge, and other places and to </p>
<p>build an observatory that exactly fitted his ideas of what was </p>
<p>needed. I was delighted by the extent to which he had been able to </p>
<p>arrange for one man operation; even the main 60-inch reflector could </p>
<p>be operated without help. My favorite instrument was the Bruce, a </p>
<p>photographic instrument with an especially large and flat field </p>
<p>(this was before the days of Schmidt optics) that was used for </p>
<p>patrol plates, a survey of the whole southern sky that continued for </p>
<p>many years. The Bruce pleased me by having the compact solid beauty </p>
<p>that was so characteristic of the best old steam locomotives. We </p>
<p>were also interested to see the old Lowell refractor that Doctor </p>
<p>Paras said was responsible for dissemination of more lies than any </p>
<p>other one instrument.</p>
<p>The living quarters at Harvard Kopje were especially comfortable and </p>
<p>we were happy to change our plans a little and spend the night </p>
<p>there. Mrs. Paras gave us an excellent dinner embellished by her </p>
<p>customary five vegetables. We learned that the grocers in </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="station">The Harvard Station</b> </a>134</p>
<p>Bloemfontein were Greeks and always supplied Dr. Paras with the </p>
<p>extremely best of everything.</p>
<p>We started early for Queenstown and stopped only near Aliwal North </p>
<p>when we encountered a cloud of locusts. These were great grass </p>
<p>hopper-type insects among which the females were at least four </p>
<p>inches long and very heavy. They were generally green, but with </p>
<p>bright red heads and legs. Inside relatively plain green and black </p>
<p>wing covers they had large salmon-pink wings so that a group with </p>
<p>hundreds flying looked rather like a constellation of colorful </p>
<p>butterflies. They were so heavy that they could not actually fly </p>
<p>very well or very far. The usual technique seemed to be to light at </p>
<p>the base of a bush or tree and eat their way to the top. After that </p>
<p>tree had been denuded, they would take off at a downward slope and </p>
<p>repeat the performance at another bush or tree. I formed the opinion </p>
<p>that only the athletes among them could maintain a flight for as </p>
<p>much as a hundred yards.</p>
<p>After some rather silly attempts to take color movies of these </p>
<p>locusts without scaring them, we discovered that they were so </p>
<p>sluggish that we could pick them up at will. We thought that our </p>
<p>entomologist friend, Dick Dow, would like such colorful specimens, </p>
<p>so we collected a couple of dozen of them and put them into one of </p>
<p>Clyde Ficher's camera cases for transportation to Queenstown.</p>
<p>At the Hexagon Hotel we vere welcomed effusively by the entire staff </p>
<p>and even found fresh flowers in our room. Bob Verwoerd appeared </p>
<p>promptly to report various breakdowns in the equipment, but nothing </p>
<p>had happened that could not be repaired easily. As we resumed </p>
<p>operation, we let our locusts run free in an empty room at the </p>
<p>cottage. From time to time we would open the door quickly and toss </p>
<p>in a head of lettuce. The sound of chomping could be heard in the </p>
<p>next room for ten minutes or so before the lettuce vanished. We </p>
<p>tried preserving a few insects in alcohol but these specimens </p>
<p>promptly turned a dull and uninteresting brown. The locusts were so </p>
<p>large that they obviously could not be dried without being stuffed, </p>
<p>which was beyond our skills. We rather vaguely decided to keep them </p>
<p>alive, if we could, for the six weeks or so before we would sail and </p>
<p>then somehow solve the problem of keeping them for Dick. By this </p>
<p>time we had discovered that, on the short trip to Queenstown, our </p>
<p>pets had eaten the plush lining out of Doctor Ficher's camera case. </p>
<p>We were to find that silk stockings and lace curtains were also </p>
<p>among their favorite foods.</p>
<p>Soon after our return came the time to make good my promise to speak </p>
<p>in the native compound. Miss Soga had suggested that we dress as we </p>
<p>would for an evening function at home, so we took the hint and put </p>
<p>on a long dress and my dinner jacket. We were taken to a large, </p>
<p>rather bare hall that was crowded with natives, many even roosting </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="ReturntoQ">Return to Queenstown / The Native Reception</b> </a>135</p>
<p>among the trusses that supported the roof. I made the easiest speech </p>
<p>I ever gave because it had to be translated, sentence by sentence, </p>
<p>into the native language, so that I had plenty of time to think. I </p>
<p>told them a little about the eclipse and our reason for being in </p>
<p>Africa, but spent most of the time discussing the difference in </p>
<p>treatment of blacks in the northern and southern parts of the United </p>
<p>States, not that I was at all expert on that subject. The natives </p>
<p>were absolutely excited when I assured them that we had a number of </p>
<p>black students at Harvard. I answered innumerable questions with, I </p>
<p>suspect, the interpreter editing or omitting many that must have </p>
<p>been regarded as improper or undignified. Catherine had accepted </p>
<p>Miss Soga's suggestion that native women never spoke in public, and </p>
<p>kept her mouth beautifully shut for the entire evening, hard though </p>
<p>it must have been for her.</p>
<p>I am sorry that I did not then know the wonderful story of the first </p>
<p>black student at Harvard. When a rumor arose that the College was </p>
<p>thinking of admitting a black man, a number of proper Bostonians </p>
<p>waited upon the President, Edward Everett, to protest. Dr. Everett </p>
<p>heard them out politely and then said, "Gentlemen, Mr. has passed </p>
<p>his examinations and has been admitted. If the white students choose </p>
<p>to withdraw, the resources of the College will be devoted to his </p>
<p>education". Since then, Harvard has had no serious difficulty about </p>
<p>color, except that today it is hard to find as many qualified black </p>
<p>applicants as the University might prefer.</p>
<p>When I finished, the natives, took over and spent hours giving us a </p>
<p>varied and spectacular show. This ranged from a Sunday School choir </p>
<p>singing a capella to what was either a highly indecent or a </p>
<p>perfectly beautiful performance of a dance celebrating a young boy's </p>
<p>arrival at puberty. We were told that the exhibition of this dance </p>
<p>had required a special dispensation from the chief witch doctor of </p>
<p>Southern Africa, not because we were to see it but because it was </p>
<p>supposed to be performed only outdoors. At the close of the show I </p>
<p>was presented a specially-carved cane. It represents a native man </p>
<p>holding by the neck a long spotted snake that spirals around the </p>
<p>cane. I did not learn why this design was considered appropriate for </p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>I was abashed to find that there had been an admission charge of </p>
<p>sixpence to see me on this occasion. Small as this sounds, it </p>
<p>represented more than a day's pay for most men. Fortunately, we </p>
<p>learned that the evening's proceeds were to be devoted to some </p>
<p>community purpose, so we contributed five pounds to the fund and </p>
<p>made ourselves even more popular. I have always remembered with </p>
<p>emotion the contrast between the formal evening at the University of </p>
<p>the Witwatersrand and this truly exciting and uninhibited reception </p>
<p>that came a few days later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="leaving">Leaving Queenstown</b> </a>136</p>
<p>Aside from our continuing control observations the three remaining </p>
<p>weeks In Queenstown were highlighted by a few dinner parties we gave </p>
<p>at the hotel to express our thanks for various acts of kindness and </p>
<p>friendship. The first of these had probably been after the eclipse </p>
<p>and before we left for Kruger Park. On this occasion we discovered </p>
<p>that the headwaiter, Johnny Davis, had a real genius for sand </p>
<p>painting when he was moved to display it. He would dye farina in </p>
<p>various colors and decorate any available space on a large table </p>
<p>with appropriate designs. For this first of our large parties Johnny </p>
<p>was probably motivated by the presence of the Mayor and his wife and </p>
<p>produced a magnificent eclipse for a centerpiece, with an orange sun </p>
<p>partially covered by a black moon. The most memorable party was </p>
<p>certainly on November 22nd, Catherine's birthday. For this occasion </p>
<p>I had bespoken a large birthday cake at the local confectioner's. I </p>
<p>was a bit surprised at the price they asked until we discovered that </p>
<p>it was an iced and decorated fruit cake. When the confectioner asked </p>
<p>how many candles to put on it, I had thought quickly and said, Oh, </p>
<p>two dozen, please, although this was something of an underestimate. </p>
<p>This cake had been delivered to the hotel kitchen and it inspired </p>
<p>Johnny to a special effort. When we brought our guests into the </p>
<p>dining room, after the customary sherry in the parlor, we found the </p>
<p>table decorated with floral designs surrounding a brightly colored </p>
<p>ribbon that ran the length of the table, saying, C.S.S.P.'s 24th </p>
<p>Birthday. When Johnny, who perhaps had some misgivings, approached </p>
<p>Catherine to ask if this was all right, she gave him one of her </p>
<p>sweetest smiles and assured him that everything was just fine.</p>
<p>At the end of November we terminated our operations and packed and </p>
<p>shipped our equipment. After the boxes had left, we returned to the </p>
<p>cottage to clean it up to some extent. While working, we saw that </p>
<p>the old native grandmother and her daughter-in-law had arrived in </p>
<p>the yard. In the customary way, they waited thirty feet from the </p>
<p>front door until we chose to notice them. They then approached the </p>
<p>porch and the grandmother made a long speech in her language, </p>
<p>interpreted by the daughter, to thank us for all our kindness to the </p>
<p>children. This was done with the most perfect dignity and was very </p>
<p>moving. The native women saw that we were doing our own cleaning, so </p>
<p>they went home and returned with brooms and brushes to sweep out the </p>
<p>cottage for us. At my request, they gave us a beautifully-braided </p>
<p>native equivalent of a whisk-broom, which we still keep as a </p>
<p>favorite souvenir.</p>
</font><p><hr>
<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="keys">Returning the Keys</a></p>
</b><p>One of our last acts was to return the keys to the cottage and thank </p>
<p>the Ritchies for their kindness. We were, of course, entertained for </p>
<p>tea on this occasion. Over the tea cups, after routine subjects had </p>
<p>been fully dealt with, Mrs. Ritchie filled a short conversational </p>
<p>gap by remarking brightly, "I do hope that you haven't been bothered </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Returning the Keys 137</p>
<p>by the cobras that live under the cottage". Catherine says that Mrs. </p>
<p>Ritchie nearly lost one of her best bone-china tea cups at this </p>
<p>moment, and I would not be too sure that she had not risked two of </p>
<p>them. At least, for several years I occasionally dreamed of a cobra </p>
<p>head and hood appearing through one of the holes in the floors of </p>
<p>the cottage.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>We left Queenstown by train for Port Elizabeth and a leisurely trip </p>
<p>along the south coast to Capetown. We spent a day sightseeing in </p>
<p>Port Elizabeth, including a visit to a famous snake farm where we </p>
<p>made the acquaintance of the African cobras we had not seen in </p>
<p>Queenstown. More repulsive snakes I never saw. They were relatively </p>
<p>flat and ribbon-like and had an unpleasant yellowish-brown color. We </p>
<p>admired the contempt with which the native keeper kicked them out of </p>
<p>the way as he went about picking up specimens to milk for their </p>
<p>venom.</p>
<p>At George we spent a couple of days exploring the only region in </p>
<p>South Africa that can be called forested. In the narrow south </p>
<p>coastal strip of lowlands there were good stands of large </p>
<p>slowgrowing trees and beautiful homes and gardens. This is the </p>
<p>habitat of the famous stinkwood, an excellent furniture wood, that </p>
<p>is in short supply and great demand. Its name comes from a faint </p>
<p>unpleasant odor that really can only be noticed in, say, a cabinet </p>
<p>that is not often opened. Bits of the wood that are too small for </p>
<p>furniture use are used to make very attractive small objects for the </p>
<p>tourists. </p>
<p>Back in Capetown we saw to the shipment of our equipment on a </p>
<p>freighter to Boston. We were to sail on the City of New York for the </p>
<p>city of that name. We paid calls on our Capetown acquaintances and </p>
<p>entertained many of them at teas and dinners. Fortunately we met and </p>
<p>entertained Mrs. Rossiter from the Michigan Observatory in </p>
<p>Bloemfontein, as she turned out to be a martyr to seasickness and we </p>
<p>saw very little of her on shipboard. We made the good Scots Dr. </p>
<p>Jackson, his Majesty's Astronomer at the Cape, very unhappy because, </p>
<p>for some reason I never understood, he had to certify our shipping </p>
<p>papers to authorize the free inland transportation of our eclipse </p>
<p>equipment; an allowance that he had been unable to obtain for his </p>
<p>own expedition. Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, who had been so kind to us on </p>
<p>our arrival, entertained us and made arrangements for us to meet Mr. </p>
<p>Thompson's daughter and her husband in Trinidad, where our ship </p>
<p>would stop for fuel.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>On a Saturday morning, about a week before we were to leave, we </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Returning the Keys 138</p>
<p>completed our business with the shipping agents. Almost as an after </p>
<p>thought, we were advised that it might be well to get visas to visit </p>
<p>Trinidad. These were not ordinarily required for passengers in </p>
<p>transit, but our agent thought that because of the war we might not </p>
<p>be able to go ashore without them. He told us to apply at the </p>
<p>immigration office and explained how to find it. When I asked </p>
<p>whether we should look for anyone in particular, he said no, but he </p>
<p>did finally name a Mr. Conway.</p>
<p>We reached the Immigration Department in the late morning. We were </p>
<p>casually dressed and dusty, and far below South African standards as </p>
<p>I was bareheaded and we were both carrying parcels of souvenirs. The </p>
<p>Department was in a nondescript old building made up of several </p>
<p>houses, with long and twisting corridors and many unmarked doors. We </p>
<p>located the appropriate office where we found only a young and </p>
<p>rather imperious woman behind the counter. I approached her with our </p>
<p>passports and said, "We would like visas for Trinidad, if you </p>
<p>please." The girl looked through our passports carefully and then </p>
<p>said, "Where are your exit permits?" Not having heard of such </p>
<p>documents, I replied, "What is an exit permit?" "Oh", she said, "You </p>
<p>must have one before you can leave the country. When are you </p>
<p>sailing?" "Next Friday", I answered, and received the response, "Oh, </p>
<p>dear, dear! We will never be able to get them in time." As I began </p>
<p>to become more severe, she weakened a little; "Well, perhaps if we </p>
<p>telegraph Pretoria we may be able to get them." As there seemed </p>
<p>little else to do, we followed her instructions to go upstairs to </p>
<p>(for some reason) the accountant's office where we could fill out </p>
<p>the application forms.</p>
<p>At the accountant's office we finally found a pimply-faced youth and </p>
<p>went through an almost identical routine with him, from "Where are </p>
<p>your exit permits?" to "Oh, dear, we'll never be able to get them in </p>
<p>time". As I was tiring of this line of conversation, I thought it </p>
<p>time to ask for Mr. Conway. The youth's obvious reluctance was later </p>
<p>explained when we found that Mr. Conway was His Majesty's Principal </p>
<p>Immigration Officer, but the boy finally acceded to my request, and </p>
<p>took us through a rabbitwarren of corridors to knock on one of the </p>
<p>unmarked doors. Mr. Conway appeared to be alone. He was about sixty </p>
<p>years of age with gray hair and steelrimmed spectacles and all the </p>
<p>characteristics of an experienced civil servant. The youth explained </p>
<p>us to Mr. Conway as well as he could and departed, saying something </p>
<p>like, I'll get their file.</p>
<p>With Mr. Conway we ran through our familiar conversation for the </p>
<p>third time. He assured us that nothing but the prompt execution of </p>
<p>applications plus bearing the costs of telegrams between Capetown </p>
<p>and Pretoria could possibly get us out of Africa in less than a </p>
<p>week. As he was politely but firmly edging us out of his office </p>
<p>toward an empty room where we could make out the applications, the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="visas">Visas for Trinidad</b> </a>139</p>
<p>youth returned down the long corridor at an absolute gallop. His </p>
<p>face wore a look of shock and he carried a file at least four inches </p>
<p>thick, opened somewhere in the middle. We had noticed a slight </p>
<p>stammer before, but when he spoke now it was overpowering. As he </p>
<p>reached us he exclaimed, liub-bubbub-but. Mr. Kuk-kuk-kuk-kuk-k-</p>
<p>Conwayl - Thetre dud-dud-duddud-dtid -distinguished visitors!</p>
<p>Mr. Conway displayed the value of his long training in the civil </p>
<p>service. With only a brief but searching look over his glasses at </p>
<p>our disheveled appearance, he made a remarkable recovery. Oh - - -</p>
<p>Oh, he said, In that case we would not think of requiring exit </p>
<p>permits, and told the youth to take us back to the girl downstairs </p>
<p>and instruct her to give us our visas immediately.</p>
<p>* * * * </p>
<p>The City of New York differed very considerably from the Lancaster. </p>
<p>She was the only passenger liner sailing between Capetown and New </p>
<p>York at the time, and she was supposed to make the trip in only </p>
<p>seventeen days, even including a day's visit to Trinidad. The South </p>
<p>Atlantic swell, which we had encountered gradually on our way south, </p>
<p>revealed itself in its full glory when we sailed. We delayed our </p>
<p>descent to the dining room until after the last line had been cast </p>
<p>off at seven in the evening. At 7:2O we passed the breakwater and </p>
<p>the dishes began sliding off the table. It was noticeable that two </p>
<p>or three days passed before we saw as many as half of the passengers </p>
<p>at mealtime.</p>
<p>The trip would no doubt have been very pleasant and relaxing, except </p>
<p>that the Professor Pierce effect made its last appearance and caused </p>
<p>us to be seated at the Captain's table. Our table mates were a lady </p>
<p>from the highest Boston society who was returning from her </p>
<p>daughter's wedding in Kenya, two State Department officers who were </p>
<p>changing stations, with their wives, and a real South African </p>
<p>professor and his wife. The members of this group, with the Captain, </p>
<p>insisted on giving each other cocktail parties almost daily, which </p>
<p>put a strain on our budget and my supply of dress shirts. I had to </p>
<p>conduct a running battle with the ship's laundry to keep myself </p>
<p>presentable in the tropical heat with, of course, no air </p>
<p>conditioning.</p>
<p>When Captain Schmidt discovered that I came from Maine, he had a </p>
<p>word with the steward. As a result I found myself required to top </p>
<p>off each large and varied breakfast with a quarter of an apple pie, </p>
<p>because I could not dishonor the reputation of my State in the eyes </p>
<p>of the Captain.</p>
<p>I was surprised recently when Catherine turned up four or five </p>
<p>certificates that I had won various contests on the City of New </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="ny">The City of New york</b> </a>140</p>
<p>York, including shuffleboard and, of all things, a spelling bee. I </p>
<p>had not forgotten having won the bridge tournament, as I was </p>
<p>generally not a good enough player to win anything. In the first </p>
<p>match I happened to be the partner of a rich South African who </p>
<p>correctly and unpleasantly made it clear that he was an </p>
<p>exceptionally good player. I misunderstood his bidding on the first </p>
<p>hand with the unhappy result that I went down three no-trump, </p>
<p>doubled. My partner's scornful reaction so irritated me that I </p>
<p>really settled down to try, and had the pleasure of coming in first </p>
<p>to his second at the end or the tournament. I have been wise enough </p>
<p>to play very little bridge since then, but I still frequently use </p>
<p>the very good corkscrew I won on that occasion.</p>
<p>When leaving Queenstown we had popped our remaining locusts back </p>
<p>into Dr. Fisher's camera case and taken them with us. Each night in </p>
<p>a hotel we would let them out for food and exercise, discovering, to </p>
<p>our surprise, that we were becoming rather fond of them. Their </p>
<p>climbing habit made them easy to recapture. We could just go around </p>
<p>the room, picking them off the tops of chairs, bureaus, or curtains. </p>
<p>If the count were not complete, it was only necessary to wait two or </p>
<p>three minutes and we would see the truants appear at the top of one </p>
<p>piece of furniture or another. We arrived at our sailing date with </p>
<p>eight locusts still in good health. As we had still thought of no </p>
<p>way of killing and preserving them, we simply took them with us. We </p>
<p>did not choose to advertise their presence on shipboard but we </p>
<p>managed to feed them quite well with fruit taken when we left the </p>
<p>dining saloon, or lettuce or carrots stolen while we took tours of </p>
<p>the kitchens. </p>
<p>We reached Port of Spain in the early morning of January 1, 1941. </p>
<p>Our visas turned out to be essential and I think no other Americans </p>
<p>were allowed to go ashore. We were shocked but not greatly surprised </p>
<p>to find that the South Africans, except for some officials, stayed </p>
<p>on the ship. Their reason was that they refused to have their papers </p>
<p>examined by the colored immigration and customs officers. We were </p>
<p>happy to discover the difference in attitude towards color in </p>
<p>Trinidad after coming from South Africa. Trinidad, of course, shows </p>
<p>traces of every nationality that ever sailed the Caribbean and I was </p>
<p>delighted to find that pretty girls came in every possible shade. We </p>
<p>happened to be introduced to a new Baronet, just created that day. </p>
<p>He was a prominent lawyer and must have been of nearly pure African </p>
<p>blood.</p>
<p>It had been arranged by radio that we would meet the Melvilles (Mr. </p>
<p>Thompson's relatives) at the Queens Park Hotel. We happened to </p>
<p>arrive first and I employed the extra minutes in buying a bottle of </p>
<p>cologne that Catherine wanted. The purser on the ship had provided </p>
<p>me with a heavy pocketful of British silver coins, and I was </p>
<p>surprised to find the cologne marked $1.80. I assumed that this was </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="coinage">The Trinidad Coinage</b> </a>141</p>
<p>done as a convenience for American tourists. At a guess, I offered </p>
<p>the clerk three half-crowns, asking if that were enough. "Just </p>
<p>right, sir, said the clerk and rang up $1.80 on his cash-register. </p>
<p>This introduced a problem of understanding the Trinidad monetary </p>
<p>system that lasted me all day.</p>
<p>The Melvilles arrived in hospitable mood and took us for a sight-</p>
<p>seeing tour of the island, including lunch at a pleasant resort </p>
<p>overlooking the Caribbean Sea. In the afternoon we were taken to the </p>
<p>race; as that happened to be the big day in the winter race meeting </p>
<p>and everyone would be in the grandstand. I was interested to find, </p>
<p>on studying the race program, that Mr. Melville (who was the Manager </p>
<p>of Trinidad Leaseholds, the big oil company, and could easily afford </p>
<p>it) had paid $8.00 for my admission and only $0.50 for Catherine. I </p>
<p>took great pleasure in pointing this distinction out to Catherine, </p>
<p>to be sure that she appreciated her relative position. Our hosts </p>
<p>paid little attention to the races but spent their time chatting and </p>
<p>introducing us to Trinidad society, including the new Baronet. I </p>
<p>noticed that the purses for the races were given in dollars and, </p>
<p>after much mental anguish, discovered that the monetary unit was the </p>
<p>Trinidad dollar but that, to save expense, British silver was used </p>
<p>for coinage. It ultimately became clear that a dollar was equal to </p>
<p>four shillings and tuppence, so that my three half-crowns had in </p>
<p>fact been exactly $1.80 in Trinidad.</p>
<p>While in Port of Spain we sent off air-mail letters announcing our </p>
<p>arrival in Boston, as the ship had been diverted there, including </p>
<p>instructions to Dick Dow to meet the ship with whatever documents he </p>
<p>needed to permit importation of live locusts.</p>
<p>After this pleasant change we went back to our sweltering ship for </p>
<p>another week. Somewhere in the latitude of Florida we passed the </p>
<p>freighter carrying our equipment and learned that she also had been </p>
<p>diverted and was going to land in New York instead of Boston. This </p>
<p>made no great difference, as we were able to have our boxes sent in </p>
<p>bond to the laboratory and passed through customs there.</p>
<p>As on the outward trip, we found the last week a little long, in </p>
<p>spite of many farewell parties and other amusements. Although the </p>
<p>ship cooled down somewhat during this week, we found the contrast </p>
<p>startling when we left the Gulf Stream and landed in Boston on the </p>
<p>coldest day of the entire winter. To our surprise, we were not met </p>
<p>by Dick Dow, who turned out to be in bed with the flu at the time, </p>
<p>so I put our surviving six locusts into a small box and smuggled </p>
<p>them ashore in my hip pocket.</p>
<p>Our little apartment in Cambridge, which we had sublet for six </p>
<p>months, was ready for us. We took the South African professor and </p>
<p>his wife and Mrs. Rossiter to lunch at the Harvard Faculty Club, and </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>began to feel at home right away. On the following day, Catherine's </p>

<b><p><a name="cambridge">In Cambridge Again</a></p>
</b><p>The first three months of 1941 in Cambridge were devoted largely to </p>
<p>clearing up matters left over from the African trip; writing letters </p>
<p>of appreciation, and composing my scientific report. To my surprise </p>
<p>we returned with more than two thousand dollars in traveller's </p>
<p>checks unspent. I have always supposed that we constituted one of </p>
<p>very few expeditions to return with a cash surplus. I wrote a check </p>
<p>for this balance in favor of Harvard University and gave it to </p>
<p>Professor Mimno. He was, as usual, squirreling away small budget </p>
<p>items for future use. His method for keeping this fund unspent (and </p>
<p>perhaps inconspicuous) was simply not to deposit the check. As a </p>
<p>result, for a year and a half we maintained a bank balance far </p>
<p>beyond our normal standard and, by great care, managed to keep it </p>
<p>untouched.</p>
<p>This surplus included, of course, the $500 donated by Professor </p>
<p>Pierce. We were reminded of this when, on our first Sunday afternoon </p>
<p>call, Mrs. Pierce, who acted as the watch-dog of G.W.'s treasury, </p>
<p>promptly asked if we had brought back her husband's money. This was </p>
<p>the only occasion on which we ever heard G.W. speak firmly to his </p>
<p>wife, as he said, remarkably sharply, "Florence, you keep out of </p>
<p>this!" The next day he called me into his office to say that we </p>
<p>could keep the money in our ionospheric research funds.</p>

<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="boston">The Boston Symphony Orchestra</a></p>
</b><p>Before I settled fully into my "defense" or wartime activities, I </p>
<p>had a most interesting consultancy. This was passed on to me by Ted </p>
<p>Hunt, who was surely already preparing for his very important work </p>
<p>as Director of the Underwater Sound Laboratory at Harvard. It seemed </p>
<p>that the Boston Symphony Orchestra had been encountering great </p>
<p>difficulties in its efforts to avoid signing a contract with the </p>
<p>Musicians' Union. The latest, and ultimately conclusive, attack was </p>
<p>the success of the Union in forbidding RCA-Victor to make any more </p>
<p>recordings of the Symphony. It could easily be predicted that, </p>
<p>without a continuing supply of new performances, the royalties from </p>
<p>records would soon decrease. In a last-minute effort to offset this </p>
<p>threat, the Symphony trustees had adopted the idea that they might </p>
<p>record, manufacture, and sell their own records.</p>
<p>I was introduced to this problem by Mr. George Judd, a most charming </p>
<p>gentleman who was the manager of the B.S.O. Under his guidance a man </p>
<p>from New York who understood the manufacturing aspects was found, </p>
<p>and I became a consultant on the actual recording. Between us we </p>
<p>selected and the Symphony bought all the necessary equipment, as </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Boston Symphony Orchestra 144</p>
<p>much as possible (without threatening the quality of the product) in </p>
<p>the second-hand market. A little room overlooking the stage in </p>
<p>Symphony Hall was fitted with first-rate amplifiers and cutting </p>
<p>turntables, and the basement, or part of it, was filled with </p>
<p>electroplating tanks and presses for the actual manufacturing of </p>
<p>records.</p>
<p>My primary duties in this enterprise were in the supervision of the </p>
<p>cutting of the wax master records. Today, with the advent of high-</p>
<p>quality magnetic tape, this is relatively easy. The performance is </p>
<p>recorded from as many as sixteen or twenty-four microphones in </p>
<p>strategic locations on as many separate tapes. These, sometimes </p>
<p>after as much as a year of study and experimentation, are blended </p>
<p>together to produce the desired artistic results, and the same </p>
<p>original material is then re-recorded to yield monophonic, stereo, </p>
<p>or quadriphonic records or final tapes. In l941 and 1942, this was </p>
<p>impossible and it was necessary to make an original recording that </p>
<p>satisfied all the requirements for a commercial release. This </p>
<p>involved much worry about the placement of microphones and the </p>
<p>mixing of their outputs in various proportions, which usually varied </p>
<p>during the course of a performance.</p>
<p>One policy decision, probably made by the music director and </p>
<p>conductor, the great Serge Koussevitsky, was that the records </p>
<p>should, be cut during actual performances. This ensured a higher </p>
<p>quality, as there was no doubt that the orchestra played better </p>
<p>before a sympathetic audience than in a "cold" hall containing only </p>
<p>microphones, but it made it harder for the recordist (if there is </p>
<p>such a word) in several ways. It was recognized that at times the </p>
<p>audience noise would ruin a recording, but it was felt that any </p>
<p>important work would be presented many times and it was hoped that </p>
<p>at least one recording would be satisfactory.</p>
<p>The greatest problem in making a record was, and still is, the </p>
<p>compression of the volume range of the orchestra into a compass that </p>
<p>does not exceed the limitations of the recording medium. Should the </p>
<p>level be too low, surface noise on a record becomes intolerable, </p>
<p>while too high a level leads to distortion.</p>
<p>[This was written before the era of the laser and the compact disc.]</p>
<p>Even if the recording mechanism could follow the whole range of </p>
<p>loudness possible to a symphony orchestra, the resulting music could </p>
<p>not be played in a small room without very unsatisfactory results. </p>
<p>It is therefore necessary to increase the gain of the recording </p>
<p>amplifiers for pianissimo passages and to reduce it when the </p>
<p>orchestra plays fortissimo. If this compression process should be </p>
<p>carried too far, so that, in the extreme, the record played </p>
<p>everything at constant loudness, the music would lose much of its </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Boston Symphony Orchestra 145</p>
<p>emotional content (except for possibly the single exception of rock-</p>
<p>and-roll) and would certainly disgust a listener with any musical </p>
<p>taste at all. The solution is for the recording engineer to foresee </p>
<p>all changes in volume. When he knows that a crescendo is coming, he </p>
<p>must inconspicuously and gradually reduce the gain so that the </p>
<p>increase in loudness may come forth with as much as possible of its </p>
<p>full glory. Similarly, he must prepare for a soft passage by </p>
<p>bringing up the gain enough so that none of the reproduced music </p>
<p>will be lost in the background noise of an ordinary room.</p>
<p>Our solution of this problem was, as it is must be for any other </p>
<p>engineer, to rehearse the operation of the recording gain control </p>
<p>much as though it were another instrument. We learned to follow the </p>
<p>printed score well, enough so that we could annotate it with </p>
<p>numbered settings for the gain control, and used whatever musical </p>
<p>taste we had to make the necessary adjustments as inaudible as </p>
<p>possible - or perhaps I should say to preserve as much as possible </p>
<p>of the artistic values of the performance. We tried, through many </p>
<p>rehearsals and performances, to use music students and other artists </p>
<p>to carry out this function, almost always with discouraging results. </p>
<p>I am sorry to have to say that, of all our trials, those using </p>
<p>Arthur Fiedler, the famous conductor of the Boston Pops, were the </p>
<p>least satisfactory. It was clear that Mr. Fiedler was too devoted to </p>
<p>the music itself and could not simultaneously maintain the necessary </p>
<p>concentration on the recording problem. The only solution seemed to </p>
<p>be to use an engineer who had a modicum of musical taste but who </p>
<p>could keep the technical problem uppermost in his mind. I am sorry </p>
<p>that we did not identify a better compromise candidate than I </p>
<p>myself, so I am sure that I "rode gain" on more trials and records </p>
<p>than anyone else. Curiously, I was never introduced to Dr. </p>
<p>Koussevitsky in the year I spent on this effort, but I still </p>
<p>treasure a letter from Mr. Judd that described the conductor's </p>
<p>satisfaction with some of our results.</p>
<p>Dr. Koussevitaky's personal habits complicated my problem. He felt </p>
<p>that his orchestra could keep time and devoted his gestures, whether </p>
<p>of the baton arm or the other, almost entirely to matters of </p>
<p>inflection. It was commonplace for the orchestra to begin playing </p>
<p>with no preliminary signal that could be seen from the poor vantage </p>
<p>point of a very small window overlooking the stage from the side. </p>
<p>This was a great trial as it was necessary, in those days that did </p>
<p>not permit re-recording, to start the cutting turntable soon enough </p>
<p>so that the record would have three or four silent grooves but these </p>
<p>few grooves could not be allowed to become many. All too often I </p>
<p>found the orchestra playing while I was still eagerly watching for a </p>
<p>clue, and the performance was, from my point of view, reduced to the </p>
<p>status of another rehearsal.</p>
<p>I was sternly assured that Dr. Koussevitsky could not be troubled to </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="recording">Recording Problems</b> </a>146</p>
<p>give a starting signal for my benefit as, in the last seconds before </p>
<p>beginning a composition, he was entirely occupied in mental </p>
<p>preparations that could not be disturbed. After watching this </p>
<p>performance many times, I came to the conclusion that an errant </p>
<p>cough in the last row of the audience could interrupt the conductors </p>
<p>concentration and considerably extend the time it took him to </p>
<p>prepare himself. I did learn to start the recorder at nearly the </p>
<p>right time on some occasions, but I failed much too often. I was </p>
<p>delighted at one rehearsal when a violinist, new to the orchestra, </p>
<p>had the temerity to inquire how the musicians were supposed to know </p>
<p>when to begin. Dr. Koussevitaky looked at him in what seemed to be </p>
<p>total amazement. "Why, -- why", he said, "When ze baton touches ze </p>
<p>air, you play."</p>
<p>By the end of the year, when it was too late for the information to </p>
<p>do me much good, the musicians had become used to seeing me around </p>
<p>and I finally got someone to provide the answer to the question. </p>
<p>This was not given without an oath of secrecy, as the musicians </p>
<p>seemed to feel that they were in deadly peril if the conductor heard </p>
<p>of their solution to the problem that bothered me. I was then told </p>
<p>that when Dr. Koussevitsky's baton gently descended to the level of </p>
<p>the third button on his vest, as seen from the position of the first </p>
<p>oboe, that musician would give an inconspicuous nod and the </p>
<p>orchestra would take its starting time from him. This confession may </p>
<p>have been akin to sending me for a left-handed monkey-wrench, but it </p>
<p>comforted me to believe that I was not alone in my trouble.</p>
<p>When introducing a new composition for rehearsal, Dr. Koussevitsky </p>
<p>had the habit of giving the orchestra little five or ten-minute </p>
<p>lectures, discussing the composer and explaining the conductor's </p>
<p>beliefs about what the composer was trying to accomplish. These </p>
<p>talks were invariably delightful and I tried very hard to get </p>
<p>permission to record some of them, as I thought they would be of </p>
<p>great interest and importance to music students everywhere. I am </p>
<p>still disappointed that Dr. Koussevitsky would never agree to this </p>
<p>suggestion, especially as such a series of records might have gone </p>
<p>far toward justifying the amount of time and energy, if not of </p>
<p>money, that was spent on the recording project.</p>
<p>One of our great difficulties was the strength of the tympanist, </p>
<p>Raman Szulc (pronounced, as far as I could tell, "Schultz"). He had </p>
<p>muscles that I never saw equalled. He enjoyed baring his arm, </p>
<p>holding a drumstick between his fingers, and letting all comers feel </p>
<p>his forearm. It seemed much as though it were carved out of seasoned </p>
<p>maple wood. His power was a trial to us in the recording room. We </p>
<p>would often think that we were ready for a passage rising to </p>
<p>fortissimo when Mr. Szulc would join in with his kettle-drums and </p>
<p>make the sound level jump above our distortion threshold. Those of </p>
<p>us bothered by his skill, or strength, invented all sorts of </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Serge">Serge Koussevitsky</b> </a>147</p>
<p>hypothetical schemes to limit his acoustical output. The most polite </p>
<p>of these was probably the suggestion that we bore holes at </p>
<p>appropriate points in the ceiling and drip water onto his drums </p>
<p>during the performance. After suffering from Mr. Szulc's </p>
<p>ministrations for some time, there came a cheering day when the </p>
<p>orchestra was rehearsing Shostakovich's sixth. At a moment when, to </p>
<p>me, all seemed to be going beautifully, Dr. Koussevitsky's baton </p>
<p>went tap, tap, tap and the music came to a quick stop. Turning </p>
<p>towards the tympanists' corner, extending his arms toward Szulc and </p>
<p>then bringing his hands together over his heart, Dr. Koussevitsky </p>
<p>exclaimed, "Ah, Szulc, Szulc, you play be-yooo-tiful - - - - but too </p>
<p>loud!"</p>
<p>Dr. Koussevitsky's instructions to the orchestra were, to one with </p>
<p>no musical experience except as a listener, often unintelligible. My </p>
<p>favorite occasion was during a rehearsal of something by Beethoven </p>
<p>when again the baton tapped three times. As the orchestra stopped </p>
<p>playing, Dr. Koussevitsky extended his arms in a gesture somewhere </p>
<p>between beckoning and beseeching and cried, "Zhentlemen, zhentlemen, </p>
<p>I moost half more gooold all over ze orchestra!" As the music </p>
<p>resumed, I could detect no difference but the tone must have been </p>
<p>more golden as the conductor made no further comment.</p>
<p>The year in which I spent a fraction of my time in this enterprise </p>
<p>of the Symphony was full of discovery and excitement. It had all of </p>
<p>the fascination of any work that requires stretching one's ability </p>
<p>and energy to the utmost. The satisfaction that should have ensued </p>
<p>was, unfortunately, absent because the management of the B.S.O. </p>
<p>found it financially impossible to continue without signing a </p>
<p>contract with the union. I never found out whether the few </p>
<p>symphonies I had successfully recorded could have withstood </p>
<p>commercial competition. I had, however, had a memorable experience </p>
<p>in a world that was new to me.</p>

<b><p><a name="war">My Wartime Work Begins</a></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was probably in April, 1941, when my life began a major turn from </p>
<p>Physics toward Engineering. Professor J. C. Street, who had studied </p>
<p>cosmic rays for years, began to sound me out about joining the </p>
<p>secret work being done at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. </p>
<p>I was somewhat reluctant, partly because I felt that I owed Harvard </p>
<p>a great deal and partly from serious doubts about my practical </p>
<p>ability. It was, of course impossible for Professor Street to tell </p>
<p>me just what the work would be, and I finally suggested that he </p>
<p>should proceed to get my security clearance so that he could tell me </p>
<p>all about the new project. To my surprise, M.I.T. yielded to this </p>
<p>request and, after the military intelligence forces had spent a few </p>
<p>weeks deciding that I did not favor the Fascists (or perhaps the </p>
<p>Communists), I was able to attend a meeting of a few people to have </p>
<p>the project explained.</p>
<p>This group, which included Dr. Street, on leave from Harvard, had </p>
<p>been organized to test equipment that was being built to form a new </p>
<p>kind of radio aid to navigation. This new system, then known only as </p>
<p>"Project C", was intended to operate in the lower part of the VHF </p>
<p>(very high frequency) radio spectrum, between 30 and 40 megacycles </p>
<p>per second. It would, for propagational reasons, serve only a very </p>
<p>short range near the surface of the earth and to a distance of 300 </p>
<p>miles or more for high-flying aircraft.</p>
<p>It was obvious that the first wartime need for better navigation for </p>
<p>the United States' forces would be in the convoy routes in the North </p>
<p>Atlantic, where a system having such short range would be next to </p>
<p>useless. I thus found myself being asked to join the group, to </p>
<p>explore any possibilities for providing additional radio circuits at </p>
<p>lower frequencies, to take advantage of the greater sky-wave </p>
<p>transmission ranges available in the short wave (or high frequency) </p>
<p>band. The proposed transmissions would be not unlike those used for </p>
<p>ionospheric sounding, but the requirement for the precise </p>
<p>measurement of time differences would be from ten to a hundred times </p>
<p>greater than had been used in ionospheric work. As the precision of </p>
<p>ionospheric soundings had always been severely limited by the narrow </p>
<p>bandwidths enforced for experimental work by the Federal </p>
<p>Communications Commission, there was no experience to indicate </p>
<p>whether the required accuracy could be achieved; but, equally, there </p>
<p>were no data that proved it to be impossible. Since this proposed </p>
<p>work was obviously important and fitted well with my experience at </p>
<p>Harvard, my doubts were somewhat relieved and I agreed to take a </p>
<p>year's leave of absence beginning July 1, 1941, and see what I could </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="office">The Office of Scientific Research and Development</b> </a>149</p>
<p>contribute. This decision waa made easier by the discovery that I </p>
<p>already had three friends In the group of about ten that existed In </p>
<p>the spring of 1941. In addition to Dr. Street, I also knew one of </p>
<p>his former students, Dick Woodward, who had taken his doctorate </p>
<p>under Professor Street after I had come to Harvard. I was especially </p>
<p>pleased to find that the head of the group was Mr. Melville Eastham, </p>
<p>the President of the General Radio Company in Cambridge who had been </p>
<p>a regular attendant at Harvard Physics Colloquia and whose abilities </p>
<p>I greatly admired. There were also Donald Fink, whom I knew slightly </p>
<p>as the Editor of Electronics magazine, and two brilliant young </p>
<p>recent college graduates, David Davidson from Trinity College and </p>
<p>Dick Lawrance from MIT.</p>
<p>Long before the American entry into World War II, Dr. Vannevar Bush, </p>
<p>a famous scientist and engineer who had formerly been Vice-President </p>
<p>of MIT, convinced President Roosevelt of the importance of </p>
<p>mobilizing the scientific talent of the country. Dr. Bush was made </p>
<p>the head of the Office of Scientific Research and Development which </p>
<p>was supported by ample funds and made entirely independent of the </p>
<p>military forces. As seen from the viewpoint of one far below him in </p>
<p>the organization, Dr. Bush's essential contribution was the </p>
<p>provision of a climate in which the scientists could work freely </p>
<p>while OSRD and its subordinate entities kept financial problems and </p>
<p>military demands from delaying or preventing the scientific work. In </p>
<p>retrospect, it is clear that Hitler's stopping of scientific </p>
<p>research and trying to fight the war with what he had in 1938 was </p>
<p>one of his serious errors. It was exactly this mistake that Dr. Bush </p>
<p>prevented in this country, in spite of determined military </p>
<p>opposition to devoting manpower to anything except production and </p>
<p>fighting. It has been claimed that microwave radar gave the allied </p>
<p>forces the margin that won the war while the atomic bomb ended it. </p>
<p>Neither of these developments would have been possible without Dr. </p>
<p>Bush and his organization.</p>
<p>The National Defense Research Committee was organized under the </p>
<p>OSRD. This committee dealt directly with the scientists. It was </p>
<p>headed by James Bryant Conant, the President of Harvard and a </p>
<p>distinguished scientist himself. The NDRC had the respect and </p>
<p>support of the scientific community. It was organized in a number of </p>
<p>divisions dealing with various scientific disciplines, of which the </p>
<p>one of importance to me was Division 14, devoted almost exclusively </p>
<p>to microwave radar.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, radar had been developed in several </p>
<p>countries. These early devices operated mostly at wavelengths of one </p>
<p>or two meters because vacuum-tube transmitters could not develop the </p>
<p>required high power at shorter wavelengths. This in turn meant that </p>
<p>the needed directional antennas had to be large. Effective radar was </p>
<p>therefore available only for large ships or fixed installations </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Office of Scientific Research and Development 150</p>
<p>ashore. This was the type of radar that detected the Japanese attack </p>
<p>on Pearl Harbor, although administrative laxity prevented an </p>
<p>effective warning. The British CH (Chain Home) radar stations around </p>
<p>the coasts of the United Kingdom had a far better record, as they </p>
<p>made it possible for the Royal Air Force to win the Battle of </p>
<p>Britain in 1940 by giving early warning so that "those few to whom </p>
<p>so many owed so much" could be concentrated to meet each German </p>
<p>attack wherever it came.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1940, Sir Henry Tizzard brought a famous mission to </p>
<p>the United States. One of his duties was to induce America to </p>
<p>produce the cavity magnetron and incorporate it into a useful </p>
<p>airborne radar system. This magnetron had been developed, if not </p>
<p>invented, by a group headed by Professor Oliphant at the University </p>
<p>of Birmingham. It could generate large amounts of power at </p>
<p>wavelengths of only a few centimeters. With the war at a very </p>
<p>critical stage, Great Britain could not support the effort required </p>
<p>to put the magnetron into production and develop the necessary </p>
<p>modulators, antennas, receivers, and other elements needed for an </p>
<p>effective radar system. Doctors Bush, Conant, and others welcomed </p>
<p>this opportunity to contribute and assigned the responsibility to </p>
<p>Division 14, whose executive body was called the Microwave </p>
<p>Committee.</p>
<p>President Karl Compton of MIT agreed to support this effort under </p>
<p>NDRC and established the famous Radiation Laboratory, which </p>
<p>eventually grew to about 14,000 people, nearly half of them of </p>
<p>professional caliber. The effort was a great success, but its story </p>
<p>is only a tangential part of these memoirs, important here only </p>
<p>because it established at MIT a flourishing defense organization </p>
<p>under the leadership of Dr. Leo A. DuBridge.</p>
<p>I have always felt, without any proof, that some small amount of </p>
<p>information about a developing British aid to navigation, called Gee </p>
<p>or G, leaked from the Tizzard Mission although I understand that the </p>
<p>mission was not authorized to discuss this subject. Gee had been </p>
<p>proposed by and developed under the direction of a brilliant and </p>
<p>aggressive engineer named Robert J. Dippy. From 1937 onward he had </p>
<p>fought for this idea and had the happiness of seeing it find a very </p>
<p>useful place in the war effort, beginning in early 1942.</p>
<p>Wherever the idea came from, a proposal to develop a similar system </p>
<p>was made in November, 1940, by the Chairman of the Microwave </p>
<p>Committee, Mr. Alfred Loomis. Mr. Loomis was a rich amateur </p>
<p>experimenter who maintained a private electronics laboratory in </p>
<p>Tuxedo Park, New York. The other members of the Committee were, in </p>
<p>general, vice-presidents or directors of research of major </p>
<p>electrical or radio companies, and included Melville Eastham. The </p>
<p>acceptance of this proposal established "Project C", one of the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="C">Project C</a></b> 151</p>
<p>first three efforts approved by the Committee. </p>
<p>The Microwave Committee then proceeded in a most curious way. The </p>
<p>representatives of the various companies divided up the problem and </p>
<p>agreed to build the components that would be required for the </p>
<p>proposed system. If memory serves, the General Electric Company and </p>
<p>Westinghouse each was to build a two-megawatt pulse transmitter; the </p>
<p>Radio Corporation of America and Sperry were to make two different </p>
<p>kinds of receiver-indicators; and the Bell Telephone Laboratory was </p>
<p>to make two transmitter timers, the most critical components. The </p>
<p>only thing obviously missing was a good idea about how the timing of </p>
<p>the received signals was to be measured and presented to the </p>
<p>navigator. The Committee made a number of suggestions, none of them </p>
<p>very workable. The best, to my eye, was the idea that one station of </p>
<p>a pair might transmit 19 pulses in the same elapsed time in which </p>
<p>the second station would transmit 21 pulses. One of these series </p>
<p>could then be read against the other in the manner of a vernier </p>
<p>scale. My sympathies, after the fact, were with the unfortunate Bell </p>
<p>Laboratories people, who had to build transmitter timers that would </p>
<p>respond to any of the several proposals of the committee, thus </p>
<p>requiring an almost impossibly complex mechanism. After authorizing </p>
<p>contracts for all this equipment, the Microwave Committee passed on </p>
<p>to other duties and as a whole was not heard from again, although </p>
<p>Mr. Loomis kept in touch with the project from time to time.</p>
<p>During the winter of 1940-1941, Mr. Eastham had recognized the fact </p>
<p>that a technical group would have to be formed to receive and test </p>
<p>the Project C equipment when it should be delivered. As he lived in </p>
<p>Cambridge and the Radiation Laboratory had been formed at MIT, Mr. </p>
<p>Eastham arranged to have this group housed there and included in the </p>
<p>Radiation Laboratory staff. The navigational work was distinct from </p>
<p>that on radar and used many different techniques, but this </p>
<p>affiliation persisted throughout the war and the LRN (Long Range </p>
<p>Navigation) group became Division 11 of the Rad Lab, the only </p>
<p>division that was not working on the many implementations of </p>
<p>microwave radar.</p>
</font><p><hr>
<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Idea">The Idea of Hyperbolic Navigation</a></p>
</b><p>The new idea behind all this activity was simple and powerful. In </p>
<p>194O, the only radio aids to navigation were various kinds of </p>
<p>direction finding that had acceptable accuracy only at relatively </p>
<p>short ranges. The new methods were to be based upon the time of </p>
<p>transit rather than the direction of radio signals. Because the </p>
<p>velocity of light, or of most radio waves, is approximately a </p>
<p>thousand feet in each microsecond, measurements to that accuracy </p>
<p>should yield position to a fraction of a mile if the velocity of </p>
<p>propagation could be predicted accurately. The proposed technique </p>
<p>was the exact inverse of the acoustic ranging that was so successful </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Idea of Hyperbolic Navigation 152</p>
<p>in the first World War, when enemy cannon were located by measuring </p>
<p>the relative time of arrival of the sound waves from their firings </p>
<p>at three or more known locations.</p>
<p>In the radio implementation it was proposed that two separated </p>
<p>transmitters should transmit short pulses, or some other easily </p>
<p>timed signals, from known locations with an accurately known time </p>
<p>separation. The measurement of the time difference between the two </p>
<p>received signals would establish the position of the receiver on one </p>
<p>of the infinite family of hyperbolae having the two stations as </p>
<p>foci. To take a case of maximum simplicity, suppose two pulses to be </p>
<p>sent out simultaneously. It a navigator received them at exactly the </p>
<p>same instant, he would be equidistant from the two stations or on </p>
<p>the perpendicular bisector of the line between them. If he received </p>
<p>the pulse from station A, say, before that from station B, he would </p>
<p>be somewhere on a curved line somewhat nearer station A and concave </p>
<p>toward that station; and the exact amount of the time difference </p>
<p>would tell precisely on which of the many curves (hyperbolae) he </p>
<p>must be.</p>
<p>Of course the navigator wants to know more than his position </p>
<p>"somewhere" along a line. This problem is solved by making a second </p>
<p>measurement on a second pair of stations (which may or may not </p>
<p>include one of the stations of the first pair). The position then is </p>
<p>at the intersection of the two lines of position. Various </p>
<p>modifications of this fundamental idea are required in practice. For </p>
<p>example, it would be very inconvenient to try to receive two pulses </p>
<p>from different stations at the same instant. This problem and others </p>
<p>are resolved by transmitting the pulses alternately so that, for </p>
<p>example, the pulse from station A is always received before that </p>
<p>from station B no matter where the navigator may be. This technique </p>
<p>makes it possible to identify which pulse is which; an important </p>
<p>factor as it is obviously better to have the two pulses absolutely </p>
<p>similar.</p>
<p>This simple description sounds as though only a single pulse were to </p>
<p>be transmitted from each station. Actually the pulses are endlessly </p>
<p>repeated many times per second in an accurately spaced sequence. </p>
<p>This makes it possible to show the pulses steadily on an </p>
<p>oscilloscope and permit the navigator to determine a position at any </p>
<p>time he may wish.</p>
<p>Nothing has yet been said about the process of getting two separated </p>
<p>transmitters to emit trains of pulses in exact synchronism. This </p>
<p>needs to be done with almost infinite precision because two </p>
<p>practical clocks or oscillators at the two stations will gradually </p>
<p>drift apart without limit as time passes. A solution to this problem </p>
<p>is to install something much like a navigator's receiver at a known </p>
<p>place within range of both stations; and to have an observer then </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Theory">Hyperbolic Theory and Experiment</b> </a>153</p>
<p>transmit to one of the stations information enough so that </p>
<p>adjustments to the time of transmission can be made so as to keep </p>
<p>the time difference exactly what it should be at the monitoring </p>
<p>point. With the oscillators available in 1941, it turned out to be </p>
<p>necessary to make small corrections every few seconds, or at least </p>
<p>once or twice a minute.</p>
<p>Even this bare outline probably includes more than was thoroughly </p>
<p>understood in 1941 about the theory and practice of hyperbolic</p>
<p>navigation, as the method was to be called later. Much needed to be </p>
<p>learned about the construction of satisfactory equipment, about the </p>
<p>velocity of propagation (at least in the skywave mode), about the </p>
<p>mathematical methods that would allow the computation of a "fix" </p>
<p>from the measured time difference; and about presenting this </p>
<p>information to a navigator in a sufficiently simple and rapid way.</p>
<p>My first step along the road was to arrange for the construction of </p>
<p>a pair of relatively low power pulse transmitters, suitable for a </p>
<p>wide range of frequencies. I had these made at Harvard because the </p>
<p>Cruft shop had an excellent machinist and radio technician, Victor </p>
<p>Ghigli, who had built much of my South African equipment and who was </p>
<p>so used to my ways that he could make what was wanted without </p>
<p>needing detailed plans and specifications. This work began some </p>
<p>weeks before I enrolled at MIT, and the cost was borne by the </p>
<p>Radiation Laboratory. The transmitters were ready in August and were </p>
<p>promptly installed in two discontinued Coast Guard stations that had </p>
<p>been taken over for the Project C high-powered transmitters. Then </p>
<p>stations were at Fenwick Island, Delaware, and near Montauk Point on </p>
<p>Long Island.</p>
<p>I was much impressed by the local electric fields from the first two </p>
<p>megawatt transmitter being tested at that time at Fenwick. I found </p>
<p>that I needed rubber gloves to handle even small tools in the yard </p>
<p>of the station. When I passed a piece of antenna wire through an </p>
<p>insulator and bent it back to form a loop, sparks would leap the gap </p>
<p>as soon as it was reduced to three or four inches. I was enthralled </p>
<p>to realize that this was exactly the technique used by Heinrich </p>
<p>Hertz in his first detection of electromagnetic waves in the 1880s, </p>
<p>although Hertz never had such an abundance of energy to work with.</p>
<p>There was at this early date no mechanism for synchronizing the </p>
<p>pulses from the two stations. My experiment, therefore, was to time </p>
<p>the pulses independently from two crystal oscillators that were as </p>
<p>stable as possible and to observe them on an oscilloscope that was </p>
<p>timed by a similar oscillator. I hoped to be able to judge, without </p>
<p>precise measurements, whether the pulses seemed sufficiently stable </p>
<p>at long distances and whether they passed through the ionospheric </p>
<p>reflection process without serious distortion of their shapes. A </p>
<p>schedule was set up for transmitting at four or five frequencies, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hyperbolic Theory and Experiment 154</p>
<p>between three and ten or twelve megacyoles per second, at </p>
<p>appropriate times of the day or night.</p>
<p>With these arrangements made, Mason Garfield, who had followed me </p>
<p>from Cruft to the Radiation Laboratory, and I set out on a junket in </p>
<p>a rented station wagon full of experimental receiving and test gear. </p>
<p>We would stop every few hundred miles and observe the pulses </p>
<p>wherever we could stay with friends or find a motel that would let </p>
<p>us, for a price, use enough electric power to run our gear. We </p>
<p>stopped in Geneva, New York, where Catherine had gone to visit </p>
<p>relatives while I was away, and we spent a few days with Professor </p>
<p>Samuel Goudsmit (with whom Catherine had studied) in Ann Arbor, </p>
<p>Michigan. From Lexington, Kentucky, I tried to telephone Catherine </p>
<p>and found that she had been taken to the hospital with what appeared </p>
<p>to be acute appendicitis. I left Mason to continue westward and flew </p>
<p>to Geneva. Fortunately Catherine's specialist in Boston had </p>
<p>convinced the medical people in Geneva that her trouble was probably </p>
<p>not appendicitis, and the crisis had subsided by the time I reached </p>
<p>her. I met Mason again in St. Louis and we pushed on to Springfield, </p>
<p>Missouri, the farthest point we tried to reach in our travels.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>While wandering in the woods behind the motel in Springfield I </p>
<p>picked up a box tortoise. Mason and I fed him hamburg with moderate </p>
<p>success and, when we left, idly dropped him in the back of the </p>
<p>station wagon with our equipment. Within half an hour the creature </p>
<p>managed to crawl into the front of the wagon and bite me on the </p>
<p>ankle. This demonstration of spunk endeared him to me, so I brought </p>
<p>him home to our apartment in Cambridge where Catherine and I kept </p>
<p>him for four or five years. He lived on the floor of the apartment, </p>
<p>frequently in dark corners, except when we got him out to feed him. </p>
<p>He dearly loved all kinds of melons, when available, and would </p>
<p>accept lettuce and an occasional mealworm, when we felt that he </p>
<p>needed protein. It amused us that he could brace himself against a </p>
<p>wall and move an overstuffed arm chair when he found it in his way. </p>
<p>In the winter he becamae comatose and we had to remember to get him </p>
<p>out occasionally to soak in a pie plate of warm water, which would </p>
<p>usually rouse him enough to let him eat a little. He was one of a </p>
<p>succession of odd pets that Catherine and I enjoyed from time to </p>
<p>time.</p>
</font><p align="CENTER"><a name="sweeps"></a></p>
<p><hr>
<font face="Courier New" size="2"><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mason and I were trying to observe our signals on a system of three </p>
<p>oscilloscopes that had circular sweeps operating at speed ratios of </p>
<p>one, ten, and one hundred. The idea was to read the angular </p>
<p>positions of the pulses as in taking the reading from the dials of </p>
<p>an electric watthour meter. This was impossibly cumbersome and </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p>Circular Sweeps</b> 155</p>
<p>somewhere on our travels I conceived the idea of showing the two </p>
<p>pulses to be compared superimposed on relatively short horizontal </p>
<p>sweeps whose timing could be adjusted to agree with that of the </p>
<p>pulses. I must admit that my idea of an electronic mechanism to do </p>
<p>this feat was too awkward and inaccurate to be of much use. </p>
<p>Fortunately, while Mason and I were travelling, some design </p>
<p>information about the British Gee system had been received at the </p>
<p>Radiation Laboratory and it was found that the same superposition </p>
<p>idea was used there. Dr. Street and Donald Kerr promptly set to work </p>
<p>devising circuits for such a receiver, using their experience </p>
<p>derived from the construction of cosmic ray counters and other new </p>
<p>devices.</p>
<p>I have always been pleased that my report of this first field trip </p>
<p>happened to be dated October 1,1941, because, after a year of </p>
<p>frantic activity, the first four Loran stations went into operation </p>
<p>on October 1, 1942. This speed record is especially notable because </p>
<p>my report said, in effect, I think it will work, but we must abandon </p>
<p>all our present ideas about instrumentation and start again. I had </p>
<p>at that time no idea how many changes and additions would be </p>
<p>required in the future.</p>
<p>My next step was to retire for a couple of months to my old office </p>
<p>at Harvard, primarily because it was quiet and closer to our </p>
<p>apartment, and try to compute the time of transit for a simple sky </p>
<p>wave as a function of frequency, distance, and time of day. This was </p>
<p>an impossible task, considering how little was known about </p>
<p>ionospheric variation at that time, but I hoped that I could at </p>
<p>least deduce the probable shapes of the curves relating these </p>
<p>various functions so that the results of a very few experiments </p>
<p>would fit easily into place. This turned out to be mostly wasted </p>
<p>effort, but it at least kept me from interfering with the </p>
<p>construction of the new receiving equipment, for it must be admitted </p>
<p>that I was by no means well acquainted with the new techniques Dr. </p>
<p>Street was developing.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>At some time during this first autumn at MIT, I, or perhaps </p>
<p>Catherine, was the beneficiary of a fortunate accidental occurrence. </p>
<p>One afternoon I happened to leave the laboratory with Mr. Loomis, </p>
<p>who was making one of his occasional visits. On the spur of the </p>
<p>moment I invited him to come home to take pot luck for dinner, and </p>
<p>to my surprise he accepted. Catherine was upset, naturally, but she </p>
<p>somehow produced a dinner for company. During the meal and for hours </p>
<p>afterward, Mr. Loomis sat and discussed the entire history and </p>
<p>future prospects of all the classified work he was involved in. </p>
<p>Catherine listened avidly, as I had hitherto followed the strict </p>
<p>rule and told her almost nothing about what we were trying to do. As </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Loomis">Mr. Loomis Talks</b> </a>156</p>
<p>a result of this happy accident, it was never thereafter necessary </p>
<p>to keep secrets from Catherine, and I was able to keep her at least </p>
<p>roughly abreast of our difficulties and successes.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>During this time and for months thereafter, we did not realize that </p>
<p>the lower frequency work would be more than an adjunct to the VHF </p>
<p>pulse system, so we kept waiting for the Project C equipment to </p>
<p>provide the synchronism that was required. The transmitters and </p>
<p>timers for Project C were delivered and partially tested, but the </p>
<p>receivers never did work very well. In fact, I do not think that </p>
<p>satisfactory synchronizing signals were ever received at Manahawkin, </p>
<p>New Jersey, a Bell Telephone Laboratories field station </p>
<p>approximately midway between the two transmitting sites.</p>
<p>In December a crude navigators receiver for the lower frequencies </p>
<p>was in existence in breadboard construction and a second one had </p>
<p>been built in more transportable form, Dick Lawrance, who had been </p>
<p>working entirely on Project C, took the breadboard to Manahawkin and </p>
<p>found that he could receive excellent signals from both stations </p>
<p>and, by relaying a continuous stream of instructions over a </p>
<p>telephone line to Fenwick, could maintain a sufficiently constant </p>
<p>time difference between our two transmissions. We therefore were </p>
<p>able to set up a synchronized pair without waiting longer for the </p>
<p>Project C equipment to be put into successful service. This was </p>
<p>fortunate as that project was encountering longer delays and greater </p>
<p>disappointments.</p>
<p>At the end of December, Mr. Eastham sent me to Bermuda to make the </p>
<p>first pre-Loran observations. I took with me Ed Stevens, a young </p>
<p>technician, and went by ship, landing in Hamilton on December 31st. </p>
<p>On this trip Ed is, I am sorry to say, chiefly memorable for being </p>
<p>fearfully seasick. After a miserably lonesome New Year's Eve in a </p>
<p>cheap hotel, we established relations with the officers at the </p>
<p>Daniel's Head Y station, a naval installation at approximately the </p>
<p>point in Bermuda nearest New York. After the holiday our equipment </p>
<p>was delivered there and set up most conveniently. We found more than </p>
<p>adequate quarters in a beautiful cottage colony at which the British </p>
<p>Ministry of Supply had pulled strings to get us accomodated at a </p>
<p>nominal rate. I am sure the present management of Cambridge Beaches </p>
<p>would be shocked to hear that this rate was eight dollars a day for </p>
<p>the two of us. As no cars were then permitted in Bermuda, we rented </p>
<p>bicycles to commute between the cottage and the station.</p>
<p>The Royal Navy accepted us In their social doings so far as our </p>
<p>irregular operating schedule penmitted. An especially memorable </p>
<p>evening party was one in which I was introduced to a charming old </p>
<p>gentleman, Admiral Kennedy-Purvis, who had been called out of </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="preloran">Pre-Loran Observations</b> </a>157</p>
<p>retirement to take a senior position at the Bermuda Dockyard. In </p>
<p>about 1906, Lieutenant Kennedy-Purvis had apparently been the Royal </p>
<p>Navy's chief expert on wireless. He was, of course, intensely </p>
<p>interested in our activities. I was in great doubt about how much I </p>
<p>was allowed to tell him, but this turned out not to be crucial as I </p>
<p>was forced to suspect that the Admiral had not learned any more </p>
<p>about radio since the days of Edward VII, and I found it impossible </p>
<p>to give him the least idea of what we were trying to do. The </p>
<p>officers we met were most helpful and, with the exception of the </p>
<p>Admiral, were very discreet and asked almost no questions.</p>
<p>The experimental work went very well. My transmitters were of such </p>
<p>low power, a few hundred watts, that we could not detect a ground </p>
<p>wave at the distance of about seven hundred and twenty miles, but </p>
<p>this did not trouble me as I still believed that my mission </p>
<p>concerned only sky waves. At all times of day we received useful </p>
<p>signals at one or more of the frequencies we tried. We quickly </p>
<p>found, as expected, that the signals reflected from the higher F </p>
<p>layer were far too unstable to be useful for our purposes, but the </p>
<p>earlier-arriving E-layer pulses were quite satisfactory. Averaged </p>
<p>over all our frequencies and times, the measurements showed a mean </p>
<p>error of about two and a half miles; and the center of the </p>
<p>distribution agreed well with our calculations.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>A computation I made at the time of this trip is of historical </p>
<p>interest. We used two of the extremely complicated Bell timers, two </p>
<p>transmitters, synchronizing equipment in New Jersey, and, receiving </p>
<p>equipment in Bermuda. I counted up a total of 768 vacuum tubes that </p>
<p>bad to be operating correctly before a navigational measurement </p>
<p>could be made. Because vacuum tubes were not as constant in their </p>
<p>characteristios as are today's transistors and chips, it was a </p>
<p>frequent accident for some circuit to jump in phase and require </p>
<p>readjustment before the measurements could be continued. Fortunately </p>
<p>these corrections could usually be made in a few minutes.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>The two-trace oscilloscope indicator gave us easy and accurate </p>
<p>measurements but had two serious deficiencies. In order to make the </p>
<p>readings the pair of pulses to be compared had to be positioned in </p>
<p>special spots on the receiving oscilloscope time base. The only </p>
<p>accurate way we had for making this setting was to misadjust the </p>
<p>crystal oscillator frequency and allow the pulses to drift slowly </p>
<p>around the time pattern until they reached the right places. This </p>
<p>was an impossibly slow process as the duty of the oscillator was to </p>
<p>be as exact as possible. The effect was much the same as trying to </p>
<p>set a clock by speeding it up and waiting until the hands read the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="bermuda">The Bermuda Trip</b> </a>158</p>
<p>right time. This unhappy situation could be somewhat ameliorated by </p>
<p>inducing random phase jumps In the timing circuits, until the pulses </p>
<p>happened to come to rest reasonably near the desired positions. </p>
<p>Obviously something better had to be arranged. We also found that it </p>
<p>was often necessary to compare a strong pulse with a weak one. This </p>
<p>meant a severe loss of accuracy because a weak pulse could not be </p>
<p>seen well without increasing the receiver gain until the strong </p>
<p>pulse overloaded the linear circuits and became distorted.</p>
<p>The most important discovery that we made in Bermuda was that, at </p>
<p>our lowest frequency of 2.8 megacycles per second, we received </p>
<p>stable and useful E-layer pulses all night except for a "fuzzy" </p>
<p>period of an hour or two just before dawn. This was a great surprise </p>
<p>as the E-layer was then generally supposed to disappear at sunset. </p>
<p>We later found that, by lowering the frequency somewhat further, a </p>
<p>reliable E-layer signal could be received all night at all distances </p>
<p>beyond 200 to 250 miles. The, lack of skywave reliability at such </p>
<p>short distances was not important as that distance region was served </p>
<p>by strong groundwave signals.</p>
<p>A totally unimportant discovery was my introduction to the semi </p>
<p>tropical humidity. I happened to hang a Palm Beach suit in the </p>
<p>closet at our cottage and leave it for ten days or so. When I looked </p>
<p>again, the suit was completely covered by inch-long fungus; it </p>
<p>looked much like a somewhat greenish fur coat.</p>
<p>In deference to Ed's seasickness, we arranged to come home on one of </p>
<p>the old Pan American flying boats. This was not much of a help to Ed </p>
<p>as unfortunately he was just as sick in the aircraft, which took </p>
<p>five or six hours to reach New York. Ed was miserably unhappy when </p>
<p>we got within an hour of our destination and learned that the </p>
<p>weather was so bad that we would have to turn back to Bermuda. After </p>
<p>a night in one of Hamilton's best hotels at the expense of Pan Am, I </p>
<p>succeeded in getting Ed into the plane again, not without </p>
<p>difficulty. This time the trip went as planned and I think Ed was </p>
<p>not as sick as he had been the day before.</p>
<p>Back at the lab I found that Dick Woodward had already corrected the </p>
<p>first of the deficiencies in the receiver. The timing circuits </p>
<p>divided the 100,000 cycle per second frequency of the crystal </p>
<p>oscillator successively by ratios of 2, 5, or 10 to obtain the pulse </p>
<p>repetition frequency of 25 per second. Between the second counter </p>
<p>and the last, the division ratio was 4OO to one. Dick had discovered </p>
<p>that the output pulse of the last counter could be fed back to the </p>
<p>second to reduce the count by one unit each 25th of a second. This </p>
<p>effect, when switched on and off, could alter the overall division </p>
<p>ratio from 400 to 399, thus yielding an output frequency that </p>
<p>allowed our received pulses to slide around the oscilloscope pattern </p>
<p>at a controlled rate that could be stopped when the pulses arrived </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="receiver">Receiver Modifications</b> </a>159</p>
<p>at the correct position.</p>
<p>I did not understand how Dick's invention worked so I set up a model </p>
<p>circuit to study. There was a capacitor that coupled the output </p>
<p>pulses back to the earlier divider. Because I could not see how to </p>
<p>decide what size capacitor to use, I put a large variable capacitor </p>
<p>into the circuit. To my surprise, I found that the capacitance made </p>
<p>no difference in the output frequency until it reached a particular </p>
<p>size when the frequency suddenly changed. A further increase in </p>
<p>capacitance made no difference until a second critical value was </p>
<p>reached, when the frequency changed again. It soon developed that, </p>
<p>if the feedback pulse were applied to a counter that divided by ten, </p>
<p>at least eight different frequencies could be obtained as the coupt </p>
<p>was momentarily reduced to less than ten. The obtainable overall </p>
<p>division ratios were thus 400, 399, 398, - - - 393. We quickly made </p>
<p>the transmitter timers and the receiver-indicators operate at any </p>
<p>chosen one of these eight frequencies (between 25 and about 25-7/16 </p>
<p>pulses per second) by incorporating in each a switch that inserted </p>
<p>one of seven adjustable capacitors. This meant that we could now </p>
<p>have eight pairs of stations operating at a single radio frequency. </p>
<p>By selecting the correct recurrence rate, the desired pair of pulses </p>
<p>could be made to stand still on the oscilloscope so that the time </p>
<p>difference could be measured, but at the same time the other seven </p>
<p>pairs drifted around the picture at different rates such that they </p>
<p>did not interfere seriously with the measurement.</p>
<p>The difference in amplitude between the chosen pulses was </p>
<p>compensated by a circuit that reduced the gain of the receiver at </p>
<p>the time when the stronger pulse was expected. The technique was </p>
<p>simply to position the pulses and adjust the main gain control until </p>
<p>the weaker pulse had the chosen size, and then to reduce the size of </p>
<p>the stronger pulse by turning the differential gain controL By this </p>
<p>means, and by adjustment of the time separation between the </p>
<p>oscilloscope sweeps, the two chosen pulses could be precisely </p>
<p>superimposed (visually) and the time difference measurement could be </p>
<p>made with maximum accuracy. I was surprised, after the war, to find </p>
<p>that I had been granted a patent on this device, which was </p>
<p>apparently one of the first implementations of a time-variant gain </p>
<p>for a receiver.</p>
<p>With these modifications, and a few minor changes, the circuits of </p>
<p>the new measuring instrument had reached a useful form. Don Fink, </p>
<p>who acted as Mr. Eastham's administrative assistant, arranged a </p>
<p>contract with a minor division of the Radio Corporation of America </p>
<p>to package our circuits in commercial form and find and supervise a </p>
<p>manufacturer who would produce a trial quantity of receiver-</p>
<p>indicators. This work, with a good deal of assistance from Rad Lab </p>
<p>people, went with amazing speed. The first discussions about the new </p>
<p>contract were held, I remember, on St. Patrick's Day in 1942. The </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="production">Receiver-Indicator Production</b> </a>160</p>
<p>first receiver-indicators, built by FADA on Long Island, were </p>
<p>received at the Radiation Laboratory before the end of August. This </p>
<p>speed was possible, in part, because FADA never waited for </p>
<p>commercial delivery of components. When a part threatened not to be </p>
<p>ready in time, an emissary would be dispatched to Cortland Street in </p>
<p>New York with a pair of large suitcases. He would buy the necessary </p>
<p>number of any parts that were reasonably similar to the desired </p>
<p>ones. As a result, probably the entire production run never </p>
<p>contained more than ten units that were absolutely identical. This </p>
<p>made no real difference, as all the receivers were sent to the Rad </p>
<p>Lab for checking and any necessary modifications.</p>
<p>I have always felt that the rapid success of Loran, as it came to be </p>
<p>called, was due largely to Mr. Eastham's wisdom and courage in </p>
<p>ordering an initial supply of 250 receiver-indicators. We soon found </p>
<p>that it took lots of units to fill the Naval supply pipeline. </p>
<p>Another negative factor was that, although the Navy could order the </p>
<p>installation of receivers on its ships, each captain was the </p>
<p>absolute authority on board and could not actually be forced to use </p>
<p>the new equipment. The value of a large number of trial receivers </p>
<p>was that, whatever delays and reluctances there were in the naval </p>
<p>system, a few units fell into the hands of officers who would use </p>
<p>them. It was then only a few months before favorable opinions began </p>
<p>to circulate in the officers' clubs and the system was able to </p>
<p>expand as fast as equipment could be produced.</p>
<p>When we were preparing for the Bermuda experiment I had happened to </p>
<p>visit Montauk Point and had seen that an excellent groundwave pulse </p>
<p>from Fenwick Island was received, even at our highest frequency of </p>
<p>8.5 megacycles per second. This stimulated the idea, which we should </p>
<p>have had months before, that a Loran slave station could synchronize </p>
<p>itself with the signals from the master station received at the </p>
<p>slave station site, and that there was no need for an intermediate </p>
<p>monitor station to perform this function. This realization led to </p>
<p>the conclusion that we need wait no longer for the Project C </p>
<p>signals.</p>
<p>Work was immediately started on higher power transmitters (100 </p>
<p>kilowatts) under the direction of Al Pote', an MIT trained engineer </p>
<p>who was the part-owner and manager of a local broadcast station. At </p>
<p>the same time, Dick Woodward began the construction of transmitter </p>
<p>timers that were less complex and therefore far more reliable than </p>
<p>the Bell Laboratory devices we had been using. The idea of </p>
<p>maintaining synchronism within the slave station meant that we had </p>
<p>to devise a way to prevent the extremely strong local transmission </p>
<p>from saturating the sensitive receiver that was needed to receive </p>
<p>the signals from the master station. In Dick's first model this took </p>
<p>the simple form of relays that closed at the right time to short </p>
<p>circuit the transmission line from the receiving antenna.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Receiver-Indicator Production 161</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Division 11 was growing rapidly throughout this period and a larger </p>
<p>and larger fraction of the people were working on the lower </p>
<p>frequency project. It gradually became clear that this modification </p>
<p>was a complete system by itself and that there was no real need for </p>
<p>the VHF system. I do not remember when the work on the original </p>
<p>Project C was finally dropped, but I believe that some of the </p>
<p>equipment ordered for that project was never removed from the </p>
<p>shipping cases.</p>
<p>By June of 1942 we had installed high-power transmitters in our two </p>
<p>stations, and construction of two more stations, at opposite ends of </p>
<p>Nova Scotia, had begun. In this connection, the Canadian Navy sent </p>
<p>an officer, Commander J. R. Foster, to act as liaison with the </p>
<p>Radiation Laboratory. Commander Foster, or John, promptly endeared </p>
<p>himself to us by taking off his uniform jacket to go to work with us </p>
<p>in the lab, and generally doing everything he could to educate </p>
<p>himself and advance our cause. He was chiefly responsible for the </p>
<p>fact that the Canadian Navy accepted Loran even more quickly than </p>
<p>did the American Navy, and he of course saw to it that the Canadians </p>
<p>received some of the very first receiver-indicators to be </p>
<p>distributed. To the American Naval Liaison Officer, Lt.Cdr. Larry </p>
<p>Harding, goes credit for coining the name Loran. He observed that a </p>
<p>shipment of equipment to Canada, addressed to the LEN Project, had </p>
<p>arrived with the words Long Range Navigation pencilled in on the </p>
<p>boxes. This was too transparent, so he expanded it to "Loran". </p>
<p>Curiously, this term was never deciphered, so far as I know. Most </p>
<p>people apparently assumed this to be the name of the inventor of the </p>
<p>device.</p>
<p>Near our two American stations, the work had attracted a good deal </p>
<p>of local interest and wild rumors began circulating. Walter Tierney, </p>
<p>our highly important construction man borrowed from the Bell </p>
<p>Telephone Laboratory, turned out to be an excellent practical </p>
<p>psychologist. He had someone paint very large signs, Fenwick Island </p>
<p>Radio Direction Finding Station and Hither Plains Radio Direction </p>
<p>Finding Station and had them attached to the faces of the old Coast </p>
<p>Guard stations. Apparently everyone knew that direction finding was </p>
<p>not exciting and, to my surprise, the local interest subsided </p>
<p>immediately to zero.</p>

<font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="spring"></a></p>
<p>In June, 1942. we had also finished one or two quite complete </p>
<p>receiver-indicators, incorporating all the modifications suggested </p>
<p>after the Bermuda trip, and electrically nearly identical to those </p>
<p>being produced by FADA. Mr. Eastham again selected me to give the </p>
<p>new system its first mobile trial. I was surprised to find that this </p>
<p>would take the form of a trip in a Navy blimp, flying from </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p>The Spring of 1942</b> 162</p>
<p>Lakehurst, New Jersey. This was actually a very well chosen vehicle, </p>
<p>because the blimp could fly slowly at low altitude directly to any </p>
<p>number of check points; something that could not be done nearly as </p>
<p>easily in a car, aircraft, or boat.</p>
<p>I must explain that the calculation of the Loran readings to be </p>
<p>expected at a given point is direct and relatively easy, while </p>
<p>deduction of the position from the readings is not simple, </p>
<p>fundamentally because the earth is not quite spherical. The </p>
<p>oblateness of the earth is enough to produce serious errors (if the </p>
<p>calculation is done for a sphere, which is the only shape for which </p>
<p>the formulae are easy) at distances of more than a hundred miles or </p>
<p>so. Loran therefore was planned to work with preplotted charts or </p>
<p>tables that had to be based upon many weeks of calculations. </p>
<p>Fortunately these computations would need to be done only once for a </p>
<p>given pair of stations; the results could be stored, in charts, for </p>
<p>example, and used forever after by any number of navigators.</p>
<p>At the time of the blimp trip no such computations had been made. </p>
<p>The idea, therefore, was to fly along the coast passing over </p>
<p>lighthouses, bridges, or any other identifiable points that could be </p>
<p>located on navigational charts. After the readings had been recorded </p>
<p>at these places, I could come home and spend several days </p>
<p>calculating what the readings should have been at each of the points </p>
<p>where an observation had been made.</p>
<p>I drove to New Jersey with my equipment on Sunday, June 7th, and </p>
<p>spent the night in a small hotel in Tom's River. In the morning I </p>
<p>was greeted by the news that during the night a pair of blimps had </p>
<p>collided and that one of them had fallen into the ocean with the </p>
<p>loss of its crew and a number of scientists who were on board. This </p>
<p>disturbed me, not because I thought that such an accident was likely </p>
<p>to happen again but because Catherine was, at this time, nearly six </p>
<p>months pregnant and I could visualize her reaction when she heard </p>
<p>the news on the radio. My first duty, therefore, was to telephone </p>
<p>her to assure her that the accident had nothing to do with me, and </p>
<p>that blimps were (in spite of the evidence) perfectly safe to travel </p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>Captain Rosendahl and the staff of the Naval Air Station were much </p>
<p>too occupied with the aftermath of the accident, and the very </p>
<p>impressive memorial service that followed, to pay much attention to </p>
<p>me and my problem. I was installed in a balcony room in the large </p>
<p>hangar and allowed to amuse myself with the receiver all week. </p>
<p>Finally on Saturday, the 13th, the time came for our experiment. My </p>
<p>gear had been lashed down on the navigator's chart table so that I </p>
<p>could operate it from a standing or crouching position in the cat </p>
<p>walk. I was disturbed at first by the magnitude of the noise and </p>
<p>vibration; it appeared that in a blimp there was no lift to waste on </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="blimp">The Blimp Trip</b> </a>163</p>
<p>sound absorbing material, and the propellers were whirling just </p>
<p>outside the thin walls of the gondola. We flew down the coasts of </p>
<p>New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland until we passed well beyond the </p>
<p>station at Fenwick Island, while I made measurements timed to </p>
<p>coincide with shouts by a crew member whenever we passed over an </p>
<p>identifiable point. This was not quite as easy as I had hoped </p>
<p>because the aircraft's power supply was not very steady and induced </p>
<p>phase jumps that had to be corrected every few minutes. These did no </p>
<p>real harm, however, and I found myself thrilled to see one pulse </p>
<p>move with respect to the other as we progressed. I had, of course, </p>
<p>known that this would be so but to see it actually happen was very </p>
<p>exciting.</p>
<p>My original plan had been to fly inland from this most southern </p>
<p>point and see how far we could receive our pulses over land. We had </p>
<p>known that this range over land would be (for the groundwave pulses </p>
<p>we were using) far less than over water, and we wanted to see just </p>
<p>how bad this condition was. Unfortunately it was a windy day and I </p>
<p>soon became airsick. I found that a blimp at low altitude over land </p>
<p>can perform all the gyrations of a small boat in a choppy sea, plus </p>
<p>a curious motion of its own as the gondola swings like a pendulum </p>
<p>beneath the gas bag. After half or three quarters of an hour of </p>
<p>misery I was relieved when the Captain came back to inquire how </p>
<p>things were working. With some apparent hesitation he asked how </p>
<p>important this overland part of the trip was to the experiment. By </p>
<p>this time I was ready to admit that it was not at all necessary and </p>
<p>was happy to have him say, "I guess if you don't mind we will go </p>
<p>back and return by sea. The ship can take it but the crew can't."</p>
<p>Although we had never thought about the possibility before, I was </p>
<p>inspired at this point to invent homing along a Loran line of </p>
<p>position. While awaiting my chance to fly I had played with the </p>
<p>receiver until I thoroughly knew the reading to be expected at the </p>
<p>Lakehurst hangar. I realized that if we flew along the line having </p>
<p>that reading in the right direction we would be sure to get there </p>
<p>sooner or later. I therefore suggested to the Captain that I could </p>
<p>shut down the equipment for a while (thus getting some much needed </p>
<p>rest) and that he might fly well out to sea and "lose" me. I would </p>
<p>then start making measurements and see if I could guide him back to </p>
<p>Lakehurst. This sounded like fun to him, so he flew sixty or eighty </p>
<p>miles out to sea. I then set up the reading for Lakehurst on the </p>
<p>indicator and found, as expected, that the pulses were far apart on </p>
<p>the screen. I soon discovered which way to go to bring the pulses </p>
<p>together and, with some trial and error, found a heading that kept </p>
<p>the pulses nearly in coincidence. From then on it was only necessary </p>
<p>to shout "a little left" or "a little right" to the pilot from time </p>
<p>to time as we strayed from the line.</p>
<p>After an hour or more I saw that we were approaching the coast and </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="hanger">The Middle of the Hangar</b> </a>164</p>
<p>that the hangar was easily visible, although not straight ahead </p>
<p>because we were, naturally, heading somewhat into the wind to keep </p>
<p>from drifting off the line. I paid no attention to our heading, as I </p>
<p>was satisfied to find that we were clearly approaching the hangar. </p>
<p>Finally the pilot broke away from my instructions to make his final </p>
<p>approach to the landing area in an upwind direction. Then there </p>
<p>was a long delay because a small engine, that was supposed to trim </p>
<p>the blimp's fore-and-aft balance, refused to start. We floated for </p>
<p>some time over the landing field, our nose pointing steeply </p>
<p>downward, with occasional bursts of engine power to bring us to a </p>
<p>lower altitude and keep us from drifting away from the field. After </p>
<p>this delay, the ship was brought into a horizontal attitude so that </p>
<p>the landing crew could catch our mooring ropes and bring us down.</p>
<p>When we landed I waited a few minutes until the Captain alighted. He </p>
<p>approached me in a state of some excitement and gave me Loran's </p>
<p>first official accolade, saying, "You know, boy, we weren't headed </p>
<p>for the hangar we were headed for the middle of the hangar!" He was </p>
<p>certainly correct, as the hangar was about a thousand feet long and </p>
<p>the precision of our groundwave pulses was such that we were </p>
<p>probably within a hundred yards of our line of position most of the </p>
<p>time, but it was a delight to have our system receive such an </p>
<p>endorsement.</p>
<p>After I had returned to Cambridge and had had time to calculate the </p>
<p>expected readings for the various places we had pinpointed, I found </p>
<p>that most of our measurements on this flight had been within 200 </p>
<p>yards, and that the average of all of them was in exact agreement </p>
<p>with the calculations. I found out later that there were better </p>
<p>methods for computing the values on an oblate earth, but at such </p>
<p>short distances the difference would probably not have been great. </p>
<p>In any case, I was so happy with the agreement between calculation </p>
<p>and observation that I was careful never to recompute the readings </p>
<p>to be expected.</p>
<p>Within a couple of weeks we had a chance to use the same receiving </p>
<p>equipment in a B24 aircraft that belonged to the Royal Air Force and </p>
<p>happened to be in Boston to have some Rad Lab radar equipment </p>
<p>installed. I do not remember which of the boys in our group had the </p>
<p>fun of this trip, over the Gulf of Maine and Nova Scotia. </p>
<p>I should have explained that all of this work with the more powerful </p>
<p>transmitters and improved receivers was done at a frequency of 1.95 </p>
<p>MHz. After the Bermuda trip, we had reduced the operating frequency </p>
<p>to 2.2 MHz in an effort to improve the nighttime reliability of E-</p>
<p>layer transmission. This was a successful change but unfortunately </p>
<p>our pulses at that frequency had begun triggering automatic distress </p>
<p>alarm systems on ships in the Great Lakes. Because the war had made </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="early">Other Early Tests of Loran</b> </a>165</p>
<p>it necessary to forbid amateur radio operation, we found it </p>
<p>convenient to make a further move into the former amateur "160-meter </p>
<p>band" where Loran remained for many years.</p>
<p>Shortly after the blimp trip, Dave Davidson took another receiver-</p>
<p>indicator for a trip of several weeks' duration on a Coast Guard </p>
<p>weather ship in the North Atlantic. This trip was principally to </p>
<p>check out the skywave accuracy at night, but it also gave us the </p>
<p>first real proof of the distances we could achieve: about 700 </p>
<p>nautical miles for the ground wave in the daytime and about twice </p>
<p>that distance for the sky wave at night. Dave's measurements thus </p>
<p>did much more than prove that Loran could provide useful service in </p>
<p>the Atlantic Ocean quite far from land.</p>
<p>The possibility remained that, by extra transmissions at higher </p>
<p>frequencies, we could extend the daytime range of usefulness to </p>
<p>equal that at night. This never would be done (although occasional </p>
<p>trials wore carried out both by the Rad Lab and the Coast Guard) </p>
<p>primarily because it always seemed more important to use new </p>
<p>transmitters for new areas to be served by Loran than for extension </p>
<p>of a useful daytime service area.</p>
<p>After these successful trials, Mr. Eastham called a large conference </p>
<p>of military officials. He had no difficulty in convincing them that </p>
<p>we had a new and useful device, and soon had an agreement that the </p>
<p>armed services (primarily the Navy) would pay for the receivers we </p>
<p>had ordered and would reimburse the Radiation Laboratory for all the </p>
<p>transmitters and timers we could construct while the military </p>
<p>purchasing people were setting up their own sources. Al Pote' </p>
<p>continued to make excellent transmitters and Dick Woodward began </p>
<p>construction of a second generation of transmitter timers in the </p>
<p>lab. Orders were placed for more of each with the Research </p>
<p>Construction Company, a modelshop manufacturing facility set up by </p>
<p>the Radiation Laboratory. This effort continued through even a third </p>
<p>generation of timers before these models were supplanted by Naval </p>
<p>supplies. We also arranged a contract with the General Electric </p>
<p>Company for a prototype airborne receiver. The model they produced </p>
<p>was probably the best receiver I saw during the war. Unfortunately, </p>
<p>the War Production Board decreed that Bridgeport, Connecticut where </p>
<p>GE proposed to build the receivers in quantity, was an overloaded </p>
<p>area and that the receivers would have to be built by Philco in </p>
<p>Philadelphia. This led to an unfortunate delay as Philco had to </p>
<p>redesign the receiver because they could not, naturally, use the GE </p>
<p>designs.</p>
<p>In the middle of 1942, we were joined by Professor Fletcher Watson, </p>
<p>an astronomer from Harvard, and also Henrietta Swope, whom Catherine </p>
<p>and I had known on the Russian expedition. These two took over the </p>
<p>calculation and plotting of the first charts and tables. They </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="charting">Charting</a></b> 166</p>
<p>brought professional expertise to this important part of the </p>
<p>program, which was very fortunate because none of us in the </p>
<p>electronic area knew enough to do the job well. This phase lasted </p>
<p>only a few months before these experts accepted commissions in the </p>
<p>Navy and moved the problems to New York, where they ultimately </p>
<p>collected a large force of computers, and sent the results to the </p>
<p>Hydrographic Office for the plotting and publication of Loran </p>
<p>charts. By "computers" I do not mean today's instruments but people </p>
<p>who thundered away by the hour on mechanical desktop comptometers, </p>
<p>aided by eight-place tables of the trigonometrical functions. I </p>
<p>believe that this force of about a hundred people was barely able to </p>
<p>keep up with the demand for new charts and tables as the system </p>
<p>expanded.</p>
<p>In August, 1942, as I have said, we began to receive the first </p>
<p>commercially-built receiver-indicators. This kept us busy with </p>
<p>testing and minor modifications for a long time. The first Naval </p>
<p>installations were on the battleships "New York" and </p>
<p>"Massachusetts". I had almost no connection with the installation </p>
<p>problems. They were handled by Dave Davidson until they were taken </p>
<p>over by a Naval group established for the purpose.</p>
<p>In early fall I was "sold down the river" by Mr. Eastham who </p>
<p>instructed me to accept a position as a contract employee with the </p>
<p>Bureau of Ships in Washington. My duty was to write the </p>
<p>specification for Naval production of receiver-indicators. It was </p>
<p>arranged that my contract salary was to be the same as my Rad Lab </p>
<p>salary had been, which I believe was $300 per month at this time, </p>
<p>but Mr. Eastham also kept me on at half-pay at the Rad Lab so that I </p>
<p>could keep a room in Washington and still maintain our apartment in </p>
<p>Cambridge. The Navy job was very painful, as I knew nothing of the </p>
<p>military way of doing things and I found myself continually in </p>
<p>trouble with one office or another. My chief difficulty lay in </p>
<p>trying to avoid a mountain of detailed specifications for every </p>
<p>component part of a radio receiver. These, when applied to a new and </p>
<p>more complicated device, made little or no sense. For example, </p>
<p>vacuum tube sockets were required to be at least two and a quarter </p>
<p>inches square. As our device needed nearly fifty miniature tubes, </p>
<p>this meant a tremendous waste of space. After months of effort, I </p>
<p>managed to get approval for a specification that really required not </p>
<p>much more than a certain accuracy of performance, with little said </p>
<p>about details of construction. This made very good sense to me, but </p>
<p>it ran counter to all naval tradition, which tended to specify all </p>
<p>details but had nothing to say about whether a device would work. or </p>
<p>not. I had to admit that this philosophy might be adequate in </p>
<p>building a ship or some other mechanism for which the Navy had long </p>
<p>(and no doubt painful) experience, and probably had more expertise </p>
<p>than the suppliers. In the case of an entirely new device, however, </p>
<p>the Navy had no way of knowing what it actually wanted and the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charting 167</p>
<p>future (unknown) contractor could not be expected to know more.</p>
<p>Fortunately the Navy knew so little about what I was doing that I </p>
<p>could always obtain travel orders to go to Cambridge whenever I had </p>
<p>nothing pressing on me in Washington. I am sure that I spent at </p>
<p>least half of my Navy time at home. Whether in Washington or </p>
<p>Cambridge, I worked on a self-imposed project for producing </p>
<p>operating and maintenance instructions for the new receiver-</p>
<p>indicators now being installed. These had twenty or thirty adjusting </p>
<p>devices, all of which had to be correctly set. In fact, if two or </p>
<p>three were wrong at the same time it might be very difficult to tell </p>
<p>what to do to correct the situation. I worked out a logical order </p>
<p>for the adjustments (which were necessary to compensate for changes </p>
<p>in voltages, temperature, or the age of vacuum tubes) so that each </p>
<p>one to be tested and corrected would remain undisturbed by later </p>
<p>adjustments. I then tried to explain in writing where the </p>
<p>innumerable switches should be placed for each test, and what </p>
<p>visible effect should be produced on the oscilloscope screen as each </p>
<p>adjustment was made. I set down each of the many steps in simple </p>
<p>language and then tested the whole set of instructions with </p>
<p>volunteers who had never seen the instrument before. I watched </p>
<p>carefully and silently while each one tried to follow the written </p>
<p>instructions. Whenever one of my victims hesitated or made an error, </p>
<p>I noted just what happened and revised the rules to make them less </p>
<p>ambiguous. After several weeks and a hundred or more volunteers, the </p>
<p>instructions, having reached a point where errors were seldom or </p>
<p>never made, were reproduced and distributed. They were, in fact, </p>
<p>reproduced again and again, with minor modifications to match </p>
<p>various receiver models, and many of the paragraphs remained the </p>
<p>same for years.</p>
<p>This enterprise kept me from becoming totally disheartened during my </p>
<p>time with the Navy. After about six months, which seemed a long time </p>
<p>as there was a war to be fought and the Loran sets were needed, my </p>
<p>specifications were given what I took to be final approval and I was </p>
<p>allowed to resign and return to the Radiation Laboratory. By the </p>
<p>time a contract for Navy receivers was arranged, however, someone </p>
<p>had reIntroduced many of the cumbersome requirements into my </p>
<p>specifications. As a result, the General Electric Company, which won </p>
<p>the contract despite the War Production Boards earlier action, used </p>
<p>many of the techniques developed under the Rad Lab contract for the </p>
<p>airborne receiver and built an excellent but massive receiver that </p>
<p>might have served well as an anchor for a small ship. It weighed </p>
<p>about 230 pounds and was, I was told, too heavy to install on the </p>
<p>bridge of a destroyer that was already top-heavy with radar </p>
<p>antennas. The small production run of this DAS model was ultimately </p>
<p>given to the Coast Guard and used entirely in shore-based monitor </p>
<p>stations that continuously checked the performance of the Loran </p>
<p>stations. These receivers were certainly the best, from an </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="buships">Serving Time at Buships</b> </a>168</p>
<p>electrical point of view, produced before the end of the war.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Radiation Laboratory had ordered more of the </p>
<p>FADA receivers. The same units were later reordered by the Navy and </p>
<p>several thousand were produced with no change except for a military </p>
<p>designation, DAS1. I do not think that the first true Navy </p>
<p>production sets were delivered in time to be of service during the </p>
<p>war.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1942-43, besides working on my specifications and </p>
<p>instruction books, I collected what data I could about the delay of </p>
<p>our skywave pulses behind their corresponding ground waves, and </p>
<p>tried to find a rule for predicting this delay more accurately so </p>
<p>that we could improve the corrections to be applied to navigational </p>
<p>readings when sky waves were used. I should explain that one of the </p>
<p>great merits of the pulse system was that the ground wave and the </p>
<p>various modes of skywave reflected pulses were all seen separately </p>
<p>on the oscilloscope. A navigator would always use the ground waves </p>
<p>(for maximum accuracy) when they could be seen, and could make a </p>
<p>deliberate change to the skywave mode when it was available at night </p>
<p>and at medium and long distances. We found that the sky wave was </p>
<p>always delayed at least 65 microseconds, which would shift the </p>
<p>apparent position by twenty miles or wore except that the sky wave </p>
<p>from the other station was also delayed, usually by a different </p>
<p>amount. These corrections were very important and attempts to </p>
<p>improve our rules for their prediction continued for a year or two, </p>
<p>although little further improvement was made after the first few </p>
<p>months.</p>
<p>On January 1, 1943, operation of the U.S. stations was turned over </p>
<p>to the Coast Guard, although Radiation Laboratory supervisors </p>
<p>remained in them and were effectively in charge for another six </p>
<p>months. I suppose that at the same time the two stations in Nova </p>
<p>Scotia were turned over to the Canadian Navy, although my memory is </p>
<p>not distinct on this point. At this time operation was maintained </p>
<p>for only sixteen hours a day, which gave us some time for </p>
<p>experimentation with various things. Realizing that we would soon </p>
<p>lose this facility, Walter Tierney found a convenient site at East </p>
<p>Brewster on Cape Cod and built us a fine transmitting station for </p>
<p>experimental purposes. An admirable feature of this station was the </p>
<p>Consodine House in Brewster where the owner, Mrs. Consodine, who was </p>
<p>then in her eighties, accomodated some of the permanent staff of the </p>
<p>station as well as the very variable number of experimenters from </p>
<p>Cambridge who worked there from time to time. Mrs. Consodine served </p>
<p>meals that were truly worthy of a New England inn, and it became </p>
<p>quite customary, when returning late after a hard evening's work, to </p>
<p>find a large piece of apple pie and a glass of milk waiting on the </p>
<p>table by one's bed. I have always been sure that Mrs. Consodine kept </p>
<p>the inn open throughout the war for our benefit, as she sold it as </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="east">East Brewster / Reorganization </a>169</p>
<p>soon as the war was over. If so, her kindness was a valuable but </p>
<p>unsung contribution to the war effort.</p>
<p>Soon after the Coast Guard and the Navy had effectively taken </p>
<p>control of the operating system, Mr. Eastham retired to his proper </p>
<p>responsibilities as the head of the General Radio Company, along </p>
<p>with many valuable committee and advisory contributions of his time. </p>
<p>Don Fink was made Division Head but, for some reason I never </p>
<p>understood, he apparently did not get on well with the higher </p>
<p>administration at the Radiation Laboratory. After about six months </p>
<p>he found it convenient to join the Office of the Secretary of War, </p>
<p>where he performed many useful services, some of them in the </p>
<p>interest of Loran. Dr. Street then became the Division Head, while </p>
<p>Al Pote' became the Group Leader in charge of the Laboratory and I </p>
<p>turned into the leader of a small group with uncertain, but </p>
<p>primarily propagational, duties called "Loran Operational Research", </p>
<p>which I don't think it ever really was. Walter Tierney remained the </p>
<p>head of what we called the Field Service Group.</p>
<p>A disadvantage of the hyperbolic systems is that, except near the </p>
<p>baseline between a pair of stations, lines of position diverge as </p>
<p>one goes farther from the baseline and farther from the centerline. </p>
<p>At large distances near the centerline the increase in errors is </p>
<p>nearly proportional to the distance divided by the length of the </p>
<p>baseline. For example, in our first Bermuda experiment the errors </p>
<p>(for a given accuracy of time measurement) at the range of about 720 </p>
<p>miles were about three times those along the coast of New Jersey </p>
<p>near the 240-mile baseline. For the ground wave the relative </p>
<p>precision is somewhat worse than this factor because at the longer </p>
<p>distances the signals are weaker and the effects of random noise </p>
<p>reduce the accuracy of measurement. In Loran the skywave timing </p>
<p>errors are large at short distances and are somewhat reduced as </p>
<p>distance increases because fluctuations of the height of the E-layer </p>
<p>are less important for relatively flat angles of reflection. This </p>
<p>modifies the theoretical "geometrical accuracy", but it is still not </p>
<p>satisfying to have to operate at long distances. It was good Loran </p>
<p>practice to keep the baseline lengths at about 300 miles, although </p>
<p>occasional pairs were set up with twice that separation. This </p>
<p>usually required the, use of directional receiving antennas at the </p>
<p>stations to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and permit </p>
<p>satisfactory synchronization of the signals.</p>
<p>In April, 1943, soon after returning from Washington, I came to </p>
<p>realize that the greatly superior properties of a long baseline </p>
<p>might go far toward offsetting the inferior accuracy of our </p>
<p>skywaves. Because a new station had been built at Bonavista, </p>
<p>Newfoundland, but was not yet in service, I found it simple to make </p>
<p>a trial of this idea. This was, by long odds, the easiest and most </p>
<p>private experiment of my life. Without telling anyone what I had in </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="birth">Birth of SS Loran</b> </a>170</p>
<p>mind, I telephoned to ask Bonavista to be on the air during the </p>
<p>eight-hour silent period Loran observed at the time, and asked </p>
<p>Fenwick Island to synchronize itself with the skywave from </p>
<p>Newfoundland, 1150 nautical miles away. This, of course, was </p>
<p>possible only during the night, which I spent making measurements in </p>
<p>Cambridge. To my delight, I found that a long series of observations </p>
<p>had an average error of only one half mile in the line of position.</p>
<p>The next day I explained my experiment at the lab. It was obvious </p>
<p>that we had a new function for Loran that would work nearly as well </p>
<p>over land as over sea water, but with the great disadvantage that it </p>
<p>could only be used at night. Quick discussions with the Navy, Army, </p>
<p>and Army Air Force confirmed our opinion that a system with these </p>
<p>advantages and limitations would not be of value to the American </p>
<p>forces. The obvious area of interest was over Europe, where long </p>
<p>range, bombing sorties were a major activity. The American Army Air </p>
<p>Force did only daylight bombing, but the Royal Air Force made most </p>
<p>of its attacks at night and therefore seemed a potential customer </p>
<p>for our new scheme. This technique was soon called Skywave </p>
<p>Synchronized Loran, or, ordinarily, SS Loran.</p>
<p>Fortunately, during the time while I was in Washington, the British </p>
<p>Telecommunications Research Establishment, a rough equivalent of the </p>
<p>Radiation Laboratory, had sent Bob Dippy to Cambridge to help us. He </p>
<p>stayed for eight months and was a powerful force for good as he, </p>
<p>together with Jack Williams (our most versatile circuit designer), </p>
<p>brought new and far better techniques to the design of our third </p>
<p>generation transmitter timers. This development notwithstanding, </p>
<p>Bob's greatest achievement was in forcing the mechanical design of </p>
<p>the airborne Loran receivers into exact agreement with the British </p>
<p>Gee sets. When the new Loran sets became available, they could be </p>
<p>put into the shock-mounted racks of the Gee sets, and would even use </p>
<p>identical antenna and power connectors. It was then only a few </p>
<p>minutes work to take a Gee set out of an aircraft and substitute </p>
<p>Loran.</p>
<p>With knowledge of these two developments in hand, Don Fink took off </p>
<p>for England to sell the new Idea to the Royal Air Force. His effort </p>
<p>was so successful that it was decided to demonstrate SS Loran in the </p>
<p>United States as soon as possible, and a team of U.S. Navy, Army Air </p>
<p>Force, and Royal Air Force officers was designated to observe the </p>
<p>trials and decide whether this use of Loran would justify the </p>
<p>diversion of much needed equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="trials">SS Loran Trials</b> </a>171</p>
<p>During the summer, Walter Tierney performed miracles of organization </p>
<p>and built us two new stations at Key West, Florida, and Gooseberry </p>
<p>Falls, Minnesota. These, with the East Brewster experimental station </p>
<p>and Montauk Point (which had been replaced as an operating Loran </p>
<p>station by a new one at Siasconsett, Nantucket Island) gave us a </p>
<p>system of two separated pairs that promised good coverage of most of </p>
<p>the eastern third of the United States. Somehow all was ready in the </p>
<p>early fall, and the three military services prepared to make their </p>
<p>own trials in October.</p>
<p>The Radiation Laboratory took no part in these trials, except for </p>
<p>operating the ground stations, but I had the pleasure of making one </p>
<p>preliminary flight in a B-25 aircraft before the official trials </p>
<p>began. It happened that both pairs could not be well observed east </p>
<p>of the Hudson River, so the first part of the flight was devoted to </p>
<p>getting to the service area. Because the Loran equipment could </p>
<p>measure only one line at a time, I was interested to see how quickly </p>
<p>I could observe one line and then reset the switches and measure the </p>
<p>second line. As we moved across New York State in the darkness I was </p>
<p>busy practicing these observations (at about one minute intervals) </p>
<p>and recording the times and the readings. One of the British </p>
<p>Observers, Flying Officer Ben Halpern, was an unofficial guest on </p>
<p>this flight. While I was busy with my numbers, I was conscious that </p>
<p>he had taken the aeronautical chart on which we had plotted the </p>
<p>hyperbolic lines, and was making little x's to indicate our </p>
<p>successive positions. He presently nudged my elbow and pointed to </p>
<p>his latest x which was in the center of the yellow patch on the </p>
<p>chart that indicated the city of Buffalo. Lt. Halpern then pointed </p>
<p>to the window and I locked out to find the lights of the city all </p>
<p>around us. This was my second big thrill, in the course of the Loran </p>
<p>work, nearly comparable to seeing the pulses move during the blimp </p>
<p>trip.</p>
<p>Shortly before the official trials began, someone picked up a rumor </p>
<p>that the Navy intended to jam our SS Loran transmissions during the </p>
<p>trials. This was irritating as the Navy had exhibited great </p>
<p>opposition to the idea of giving up any of its pool of equipment to </p>
<p>anyone; perhaps least of all, to the Royal Air Force. As soon as I </p>
<p>heard the rumor I took the train to Washington and stormed into the </p>
<p>office of the Navy's Director of Communications to protest such a </p>
<p>dirty trick. Admiral Redman assured me that the Navy would not think </p>
<p>of such a thing, and said it so blandly that he fooled me </p>
<p>completely. Two days later the trials began and the Navy promptly </p>
<p>turned on its jammers. It was our great good fortune that our </p>
<p>equipment withstood the jamming better than we, or anyone else, had </p>
<p>expected that it could. As three weeks of trials all over the </p>
<p>eastern United States showed an average error between one and two </p>
<p>miles in spite of the jamming efforts, we had to conclude that the </p>
<p>Navy had inadvertently done us a favor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SS Loran Trials 172</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As could have been predicted, the Royal Air Force representatives at </p>
<p>the trials were in favor of using SS Loran in Europe, while the </p>
<p>officers from the American Navy were opposed to it. This left the </p>
<p>decision to the Army Air Force which voted in favor of its brother </p>
<p>airmen rather than with its sister service. The equipment was </p>
<p>promptly taken out of the experimental stations and shipped to </p>
<p>Europe and Africa. An original idea had hoped for a station near </p>
<p>Leningrad, but this was changed to a more practical plan of a </p>
<p>station near Aberdeen in Scotland forming a pair with one in </p>
<p>Bizerte, Tunisia, while a second pair extended from Oran Algeria, to </p>
<p>Apollonia in Libya. This network gave good coverage for high-flying </p>
<p>aircraft, roughly from central Spain to the border of the USSR and </p>
<p>from near the English Channel to Sicily and Northern Greece.</p>
<p>The Radiation Laboratory sent abroad a couple of engineers for each </p>
<p>station, to assist in construction and operation, and my secretary </p>
<p>and I were detailed to London to coordinate their activities. This </p>
<p>turned out to be a misnomer, as my duties in London became almost </p>
<p>entirely political; an area in which my abilities were, and are, </p>
<p>minimal.</p>

<b><p><a name="wartimewinter">A Wartime Winter in England</a></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My trip to England was on the "Queen Mary", where fortunately I was </p>
<p>given a bunk in the first class area. The ship was crowded with </p>
<p>17,000 American troops, of whom a third had to sleep on the decks. </p>
<p>Our first class cabin, that would normally hold two, had fourteen </p>
<p>people in double-deck bunks with barely room to move between and </p>
<p>around them. There was time to serve only two meals a day and I </p>
<p>never learned what they were named; I do however recall that somehow </p>
<p>the Queen Mary had the best kippers I ever ate, so one of the meals </p>
<p>must have been breakfast. Among the saddest sights I ever saw was </p>
<p>our old-time steward doing his best to give Cunard service under </p>
<p>these trying conditions. I found that from my cabin on the Main Deck </p>
<p>it took me three minutes or more to reach a lifeboat. I wondered </p>
<p>about the chances of the soldiers on the seventeen decks below us, </p>
<p>if we did ever have any trouble. The ship sailed unescorted, as was </p>
<p>the habit of the two Queens which trusted their speed and routes </p>
<p>intended to keep them away from any known concentrations of enemy </p>
<p>submarines.</p>
<p>We were, of course, told nothing about where we were at any time </p>
<p>but, for some reason I cannot imagine, the ship's clocks were </p>
<p>corrected in twenty-minute steps as our longitude changed. Since the </p>
<p>month was November, our northern latitude could be estimated with a </p>
<p>pocket slide-rule and a casual measurement of the length of the </p>
<p>daylight. It was thus not difficult to Judge our position within a </p>
<p>few degrees of arc. I am quite sure that we went southeast until we </p>
<p>passed well beyond Bermuda, up the center of the Atlantic to a point </p>
<p>very near Iceland, if not north of it, and then dropped down through </p>
<p>the Hebrides until we entered the river Clyde, where the ship had </p>
<p>been built. The trip, even at the Queen Mary's speed of 32 knots or </p>
<p>more, took almost a week. When we left her in a lighter, the sight </p>
<p>of the Queen, sitting up like a desert pyramid in the middle of a </p>
<p>landscape of green fields and cows, was extremely odd.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I caught the flu in the last day or two on the ship. </p>
<p>After shivering all night in a train to London, I had to settle in a </p>
<p>small hotel for a couple of weeks before I could attack my new </p>
<p>duties. The first of these was difficult and embarassing. We had </p>
<p>cabled to London all the latest information about skywave delay. As </p>
<p>the system did not use ground wave; these sky-wave corrections were </p>
<p>included in calculating the lines of position shown on the </p>
<p>navigators' charts. The standard delay values for the night-time E </p>
<p>layer corresponded to a layer height between 92 and 95 kilometers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="chartingtrouble">Charting Troubles</b> </a>174</p>
<p>Professor Appleton, like all other ionospheric experts, knew little </p>
<p>about nighttime reflections but insisted that the E layer over </p>
<p>England was at a height of 110 kilometers, which was about the value </p>
<p>measured anywhere by vertical incidence sounding in daytime. </p>
<p>Professor Appleton's influence was so strong that the British charts </p>
<p>had been calculated on this basis and were seriously in error. </p>
<p>Almost my first appearance in public was in a large meeting where I </p>
<p>had to dispute this matter with Professor Appleton.</p>
<p>This was the first of many occasions when I came to respect, and </p>
<p>even admire, the English talent for making a foreigner's opinion </p>
<p>appear negligible. Professor Appleton and his surrounding assistants </p>
<p>insisted that they had experimental data to prove their case. I </p>
<p>suspected that these suffered, as had almost all ionospheric </p>
<p>measurements, from the differentiating effect of a strong groundwave </p>
<p>pulse, but I could not convince the meeting of the soundness of my </p>
<p>ideas.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a week or two later, I was able to induce Mr. Naismith, </p>
<p>one of Appleton's chief assistants, to make a measurement on a Loran </p>
<p>signal from Iceland (which had just begun to operate) where the </p>
<p>conditions were reversed and Naismith had to measure from a weak </p>
<p>ground-wave to a strong skywave. As his ionospheric equipment lacked </p>
<p>the gain-adjusting feature of the Loran receiver, he found the </p>
<p>differentiating effect reversed and deduced a layer height of 80 </p>
<p>kilometers. I was then able to take a Loran receiver, with its </p>
<p>amplitude-balance control, and demonstrate our expected value of the </p>
<p>delay. This settled the controversy in my favor, but unhappily the </p>
<p>beautiful charts from His Majesty's Stationery Office had to be </p>
<p>scrapped. The new charts, when recomputed and redrawn, turned out to </p>
<p>be entirely satisfactory. Because other delays would be encountered, </p>
<p>the time lost in this episode was not to become important.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>Winter in London, for a foreigner forced to live on the civilian </p>
<p>economy, was bleak. Hotels were supposed to keep a guest for only </p>
<p>five days, but many smaller ones put their prices up a bit and paid </p>
<p>little attention to this regulation. As I was often in London for, </p>
<p>only a week or so and then away on a short trip somewhere, I was not </p>
<p>greatly bothered. Either my hotel would keep me a few extra days or </p>
<p>the OSED staff would find me another place. I never really unpacked </p>
<p>my bags and, when I got home, found in them several useful things </p>
<p>that I had forgotten I had. Although the O.S.R.D. offices in Park </p>
<p>Street were relatively warm, as English buildings went, one got used </p>
<p>to never really being warm enough. Host fireplaces operated on a </p>
<p>supply of three or four hundred pounds of coal for the winter. I </p>
<p>never understood how an open fire could be maintained with a nucleus </p>
<p>of burning coal only about the size of a softball. Needless to say, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charting Troubles 175</p>
<p>these gave out almost no detectable heat. It was sometimes possible </p>
<p>to draw enough water for a bath that would warm one to some extent, </p>
<p>but to do this it was necessary to disregard the signs recommending </p>
<p>conservation of hot water and to pay no attention to the water level </p>
<p>painted in the tub which silently recommended a depth that would </p>
<p>almost cover one's insteps when he got in.</p>
<p>Food was the worst problem. Although I was technically entitled to </p>
<p>eat in American Army messes, I almost never found myself near one at </p>
<p>mealtime. The rules said that no restaurant or hotel could charge </p>
<p>more than five shillings for a meal, except that oysters or coffee </p>
<p>could be supplied for a shilling or two extra. Breakfast usually </p>
<p>consisted of a reconstituted scrambled egg and a pair of bangers, or </p>
<p>sausages that were legally supposed to contain at least twenty </p>
<p>percent of meat. Everyone was entitled to get a fresh egg every </p>
<p>month, but in my four-month stay I only received mine on a single </p>
<p>occasion. Once when I managed to surmount my hesitation and invade </p>
<p>Claridge's Hotel, among the Maharajas and the generals, I was made </p>
<p>almost teary with sympathy for the pride with which the headwaiter </p>
<p>assured me that my omelet would be made with a real cracked egg. In </p>
<p>spite of my beat efforts to eat, I lost about twenty-five pounds </p>
<p>(weight) during my stay in England, and acquired a distaste for Spam </p>
<p>and brussels sprouts that has lasted, so far, for forty years.</p>
<p>I remember two or three flavorful exceptions to the general run of </p>
<p>unpleasant or tasteless food. A little hotel named Simonds (that had </p>
<p>disappeared completely when next I visited England) accomodated me </p>
<p>as often as any other. It had, adjacent to the bar in the basement, </p>
<p>a sort of lunch counter presided over by a genial man named George </p>
<p>who would on request concoct a salad. His only ingredients were very </p>
<p>good lettuce and some remarkably sturdy onions. These he drenched </p>
<p>with a throat-cutting vinegar that would bring out the perspiration </p>
<p>on one's forehead, no matter how cold he might be. There was a brief </p>
<p>period when George had a large tin of Argentine corned beef. During </p>
<p>this interval a corned beef sandwich and George's salad would </p>
<p>constitute a supper all components of which had flavor.</p>
<p>One day when passing through Paddington Station, I noticed a dusty </p>
<p>stack of tins in a shop window. A small, fly-specked, and </p>
<p>discouraged sign at the bottom of the window said plaintively, "This </p>
<p>is peanut butter. In America people feed it to their children". I </p>
<p>bought two of the large tins. One of them was rancid; the second was </p>
<p>excellent and brightened many of our teas at the O.S.R.D. offices.</p>
<p>There were, of course, occasional light-hearted occasions. One of </p>
<p>these was when the O.S.R.D. held an ordinary Christmas party for the </p>
<p>staff. Because of my illness and some errands outside of London, I </p>
<p>had met very few people at our headquarters. This fact inspired Sam </p>
<p>Goudsmit, my acquaintance from Ann Arbor, to propose a pleasant </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="lifeinlondon">Life in War-Time London</b> </a>176</p>
<p>game. Whenever we found an unoccupied girl Sam would hold a piece of </p>
<p>mistletoe over her head and I would kiss her. I would then step </p>
<p>smartly back one pace so that Sam could introduce me. I was not told </p>
<p>what Sam was doing in England at this time. I suppose he was </p>
<p>primarily waiting for a chance to get on to the Continent to find </p>
<p>out how far Germany had progressed toward the atomic bomb, as </p>
<p>described in his book "Alsos". This work he performed very well, </p>
<p>many months later, but with meagre results as the fears that Hitler </p>
<p>might beat us to this goal proved to be completely unfounded,</p>
<p>Another happy moment came when I received an Army cablegram </p>
<p>addressed, as was routine, to General Eisenhower, that said, in </p>
<p>part, "Affirmative indications on CSP project". This was the news </p>
<p>that I had requested on my departure from Cambridge, confirming our </p>
<p>suspicion that Catherine was again pregnant. My elation lasted only </p>
<p>a few weeks, however, before I heard that another miscarriage had </p>
<p>taken place. This news, combined with the dreary weather and semi-</p>
<p>starvation, threw me Into my worst fit of depression since the death </p>
<p>of my mother. Fortunately, there was so much to be done that I could </p>
<p>not let this fact interfere much with my work.</p>
<p>My worst political troubles soon appeared. The Royal Navy was </p>
<p>determined that the SS Loran system should not be installed. The </p>
<p>pretext was that the pulses would interfere with the reception of </p>
<p>signals from small enemy ships in the North Sea, apparently an </p>
<p>important part of the naval intelligence network. I have always felt </p>
<p>that the British Navy was simply doing a favor for the American Navy </p>
<p>which, as I have said, wished to maintain control of the entire </p>
<p>Loran program. In any case, I suffered intensely through innumerable </p>
<p>meetings, enjoying (in a way) seeing how the naval officers could </p>
<p>somehow pass me a cup of tea with one hand and a plate of cakes with </p>
<p>the other and manage simultaneously to drive a knife in between my </p>
<p>kidneys. In all of this wrangle, the Royal Air Force was of only </p>
<p>moderate help, mostly because Group Captain Foss, who had the </p>
<p>primary responsibility for the defence, was apparently intimidated </p>
<p>by the forces the Navy could array against him. One of my few </p>
<p>cheering moments came when a friend, who was a senior officer at </p>
<p>T.R.E., said to me in disgust, "I have just spent the entire morning </p>
<p>trying to stiffen Group Captain Foss's weak knees!" I am sorry to </p>
<p>speak ill of the Group Captain, because he was a very charming man </p>
<p>who was later killed in an aircraft accident in India, but I am sure </p>
<p>that many of our troubles were seriously compounded by his </p>
<p>indecisive ways.</p>
<p>It was finally decided that Loran would stand or fall as a result of </p>
<p>communication trials conducted in the North Sea. These were finally </p>
<p>organized in February, 1944, and took the form of trying to copy </p>
<p>nonsense morse signals between a survey ship and a pair of trawlers. </p>
<p>These vessels spent several days at various distances from the Loran </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="trialinnorthsea">Trials in the North Sea</b> </a>177</p>
<p>station near Aberdeen and from each other, and interchanged signals </p>
<p>with and without Loran interference. I was invited to be a spectator </p>
<p>on the survey ship, where I was treated with the utmost deference. </p>
<p>The morning routine amused me especially. At seven, a sailor would </p>
<p>open my cabin door and announce the time. Thirty seconds later, </p>
<p>another sailor would appear with my morning tea. A third sailor </p>
<p>would presently arrive, bringing my boots that someone had polished; </p>
<p>to be followed by a fourth who brought my hot water for shaving. It </p>
<p>was also a pleasure to have access to a wardroom with a good supply </p>
<p>of whisky, as in London I had found that a pub would often open for </p>
<p>the evening with a supply of only one or two bottles. A "single" </p>
<p>there was completely lost in the soda, while a double might be as </p>
<p>much as a quarter-inch deep in a small glass. On the ship the ample </p>
<p>supplies came from naval stores at fictitiously low prices. This </p>
<p>vessel observed a simple and satisfactory custom under which, no </p>
<p>matter which officer ordered a round of drinks, the steward kept </p>
<p>track and charged them to the men who drank them. When I left the </p>
<p>ship, I paid a chit for less than three dollars covering all the </p>
<p>drinks I had cared to have in five days.</p>
<p>If my mood had been a little better, I would have recognized the </p>
<p>trials as being a comedy. They consisted in exchanging groups of </p>
<p>letters in morse code between, say, a vessel twenty miles from the </p>
<p>Loran station and one a hundred and fifty miles away, alternately </p>
<p>with and without the Loran station transmitting. The ships would </p>
<p>then move to other locations and try again. Fortunately for Loran, </p>
<p>the receivers they used (although new) were of the old "single </p>
<p>circuit" design that I had not seen since my amateur days about </p>
<p>1925. Their selectivity was very poor, which meant that they did not </p>
<p>"ring" under the impact of the Loran pulses as better receivers </p>
<p>might have done. The result was that the pulses were heard as an </p>
<p>annoying series of loud sharp clicks that failed to interfere </p>
<p>seriously with the sustained tones of the morse code signals. The </p>
<p>radio operators also seemed very poor and did, as a matter of fact, </p>
<p>succeed in reading correctly only about two-thirds of the nonsense </p>
<p>groups. This ratio was so poor that it was not detectably affected </p>
<p>by the presence or absence of the Loran pulses, even when the vessel </p>
<p>was within a mile of the interfering station.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the trials, the captain of our ship, perhaps </p>
<p>not maliciously, led me into my worst political error by asking for </p>
<p>help in composing his report. He claimed to have no clear </p>
<p>understanding of what his orders required, and I was glad to help </p>
<p>him. I was not totally naive, so between us we concocted a report </p>
<p>that really drew no conclusions but exhibited the statistics of the </p>
<p>messages received in a way that clearly showed that the Loran </p>
<p>interference was not serious. I should, of course, have refused to </p>
<p>have anything to do with the report becausethe Admiralty promptly </p>
<p>seized upon my participation as an excuse for denouncing the entire </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Delays">Delays and, Finally, Operation</b> </a>178</p>
<p>test program. The issue was not resolved until after I had left </p>
<p>England, when the British Branch of the Radiation Laboratory, a </p>
<p>group that cooperated with the T.R.E. at Malvern in the introduction </p>
<p>and support of the new radar devices, helped the R.A.F. in demanding </p>
<p>and carrying out a second series of trials. These, I am happy to </p>
<p>say, also proved that the claim of Loran interference was not well </p>
<p>founded, and authorization to proceed with the Loran program was </p>
<p>finally received.</p>
<p>All of this shilly-shallying was not, as it happened, what actually </p>
<p>delayed the introduction of SS Loran in Europe. Our most crushing </p>
<p>blow was the discovery that the production run of airborne receivers </p>
<p>was hopelessly deficient, as the high-voltage power supplies and </p>
<p>leads burst out with coronal discharges (which created intolerable </p>
<p>radio interference) at altitudes above 4000 feet. By the time </p>
<p>better-insulated transformers and high-voltage leads were procured </p>
<p>and fitted into the sets, the spring season was so far advanced that </p>
<p>it was decided to wait until the long nights came again in the fall </p>
<p>before introducing the system.</p>
<p>As it turned out, SS Loran was then helpful because the Germans had </p>
<p>at last developed airborne direction-finding equipment that </p>
<p>permitted fighter planes to find and attack the bombers that were </p>
<p>using the H2S microwave radars. Soon after Loran was introduced, the </p>
<p>situation became so bad that the British aircraft were only allowed </p>
<p>to turn on their radars for the ten minutes before they were due to </p>
<p>reach their targets. The radars were thus useless as navigation </p>
<p>aids, and many confused aircraft bombed areas that, on radar, </p>
<p>superficially resembled the proper targets. As a final result, SS </p>
<p>Loran was used to some extent for area bombing as well as for en-</p>
<p>route navigation. We were pleased when we found that the accuracy of </p>
<p>the system was good enough so that Berlin, as a major example, could </p>
<p>be resolved into nearly a hundred districts. This was by no means </p>
<p>pinpoint bombing, but it resulted in fewer lost aircraft and aborted </p>
<p>missions. We were convinced that the system was useful when, a month </p>
<p>or two before the end of the European part of the war, we received </p>
<p>copies of intercepted messages ordering various German broadcast </p>
<p>stations to move to the Loran frequency and broadcast noise from </p>
<p>electric fans in an attempt to jam our signals.</p>

<font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="winterday"></a></p>
<p>In January or early February, I had a memorable ride from Yorkshire </p>
<p>to London. John (actually Clifford Charles Edward) Bellringer, Bob </p>
<p>Dippy's right hand man at T.R.E., and I had gone to a place called </p>
<p>Danby Beacon, on the moors in the North Riding, to inspect an </p>
<p>abortive effort to set up a Loran network for local use by aircraft </p>
<p>returning to England. My chief recollection there is of our stay in </p>
<p>the Fox and Hounds, an old stone inn that was fearfully cold and </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Winter Day 179</p>
<p>where I was sure the wind blew even harder indoors than outside. </p>
<p>When we left, we started for London in John's tiny automobile at </p>
<p>about five o'clock in the morning. Dawn began as we descended to a </p>
<p>lower elevation, and we drove into the worst freezing fog I </p>
<p>remember, even after a boyhood in Maine. It soon got so bad that we </p>
<p>could drive no more than a hundred yards before having to stop and </p>
<p>scrape the ice from the windshield. After fighting this weather for </p>
<p>an hour or so, we realized that these conditions prevailed only </p>
<p>below a certain height. As John had an excellent set of contour </p>
<p>maps, we used them to guide us up above the fog, and then worked our </p>
<p>way south by any roads that went in more or less the right direction </p>
<p>while remaining above the critical height. As the sun got higher it </p>
<p>began to dispel the fog and we were gradually able to go lower </p>
<p>until, in the middle of the morning, we got down near sea level and </p>
<p>bowled cheerily down the Great North Road in one of the winter's few </p>
<p>clear and sunny days.</p>
<p>All then went very pleasantly until about five in the afternoon </p>
<p>when, just as the light failed, we dipped down into the Thames </p>
<p>valley and into the worst pea-soup fog we had during that winter. </p>
<p>Our rate of progress promptly dropped nearly to zero. Fortunately we </p>
<p>had reached a region where the streets had curbs. We could drive for </p>
<p>one block at a time with John keeping his foot on the accelerator </p>
<p>barely enough to maintain a speed of four or five miles an hour, </p>
<p>while I (in the left-hand passengers seat) leaned out of the window </p>
<p>with a flashlight pointed at the curb and steered the car with my </p>
<p>right hand. As we were, in a very small car, I could bring the </p>
<p>flashlight within a foot of the curb so that I was able to see it. </p>
<p>This would work very well until we came to an intersection, when the </p>
<p>curb would swoop away into the darkness. We would then stop and get </p>
<p>out to explore the intersection to discover where we needed to go. </p>
<p>When John understood our position, I would walk slowly in front of </p>
<p>the car with the flashlight pointed at John (now in the drivers </p>
<p>seat) from a point nearly over the radiator. He could then tell </p>
<p>where to drive, following the flashlight until we cleared the </p>
<p>intersection and could start curb-following again. At some </p>
<p>intersections we would find other invisible travelers and would </p>
<p>engage in merry exchanges of opinion about where we were. At others </p>
<p>we would be reduced to climbing signposts with a flashlight to get </p>
<p>close enough to read the signs. By nine-thirty P.M., we had slowly </p>
<p>traversed nearly five miles in the outskirts of London and reached a </p>
<p>point where we could abandon the car in someone's driveway and walk </p>
<p>to an outlying Underground station. The train took us the rest of </p>
<p>the way to our hotels and John was, the next morning, able to go </p>
<p>back to find and retrieve his car.</p>
<p>It was routine, in London in a combination of blackout and fog, to </p>
<p>come up from the Underground, seeing nothing, to be picked up by a </p>
<p>mysterious little man or boy who would guide one to his destination. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="blitz">Nightwear / The Little Blitz</b> </a>180</p>
<p>It was an eerie experience thus to be guided by and to give a tip to </p>
<p>someone you never saw. </p>
<p>At some time during the winter I was the beneficiary of a curious </p>
<p>incident. A new man from the Radiation Laboratory, Raymond Webster, </p>
<p>arrived in England and for a single night he and I shared a room in </p>
<p>Simonds' Hotel before he went to a station in Shropshire. It </p>
<p>happened that we had a very noisy air raid that night and my </p>
<p>roommate woke me in excitement to say, "What do we do now?" As I was </p>
<p>an old hand by then I told him firmly, "Roll over and sleep", </p>
<p>leaving him astonished at my courage until he learned that there </p>
<p>wasn't really much else to be done. After he left London, and while </p>
<p>I was busy at the office, the hotel moved my gear to a single room. </p>
<p>When I returned I found not only my own bags but also the most </p>
<p>beautiful pair of broadcloth pajamas I ever saw and a fine wool </p>
<p>dressing gown. Assuming that these must be Webster's, I kept them </p>
<p>for three or four days as I happened soon to be going to visit </p>
<p>Webster's station. When I got there he denied ever having seen the </p>
<p>articles so I brought them back to Simonds', as examination had </p>
<p>shown that they had come from one of the finest English stores. By </p>
<p>that time no one at the hotel had the least idea who owned the </p>
<p>clothes, so I had no alternative but to keep them. I was so </p>
<p>delighted by the pajamas that I wore them out in a couple of years. </p>
<p>The dressing gown was a trifle too small to be comfortable for me, </p>
<p>so Catherine took it over. To this day she uses it when in New York </p>
<p>State and it is still in excellent condition.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>In late January and February, 1944, London was subjected to what was </p>
<p>called either the "little blitz" or the "baby blitz". In the </p>
<p>preceding months the Germans had bombed London about once a week </p>
<p>with the relatively small force that could be mounted at that time. </p>
<p>In the little blitz the bombing attacks occurred almost nightly </p>
<p>except for perhaps one night a week when the weather was impossibly </p>
<p>bad. It did not happen that any bombs fell close enough to me to be </p>
<p>disturbing, but one got used to the noise and the rain of anti-</p>
<p>aircraft shell fragments that fell like heavy hail and broke an </p>
<p>occasional window. It was also entertaining to walk in Hyde Park at </p>
<p>night to see whether any of the searchlights could locate a German </p>
<p>bomber among the clouds.</p>
<p>In February it happened that John Bellringer and I had a morning </p>
<p>appointment with Air Vice Marshal Tait, the Director of Signals for </p>
<p>the Royal Air Force. We were so early that we had to wait for the </p>
<p>Air Vice Marshal to return from the morning staff meeting. He </p>
<p>arrived obviously disturbed because, among other things, the night's </p>
<p>damage had included the destruction of a Booth's gin factory; news </p>
<p>that had brought a simultaneous groan of despair from the entire </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nightwear / The Little Blitz 181</p>
<p>staff! Perhaps his emotion caused him to tell us more than he should </p>
<p>have disclosed about the situation.</p>
<p>News reports of the German air raids were always made to sound </p>
<p>innocuous. It was commonplace to read that bombs had fallen on a </p>
<p>park in southern England, a euphemism that often referred to Hyde </p>
<p>Park. Air Vice Marshal Tait told us that the situation was worse </p>
<p>than we had realized. The German force, fortunately of only about </p>
<p>150 aircraft, was successfully dropping bombs in the most sensitive </p>
<p>places. For example, one or two sticks of bombs might fall on </p>
<p>Whitehall; then with gaps of several miles, bombs would fall on </p>
<p>Eisenhower's and Montgomery's headquarters, or other places that </p>
<p>were best calculated to interfere with the invasion plans. The bombs </p>
<p>seldom seemed to fall more than a couple of hundred yards from the </p>
<p>intended targets, and the targets were well chosen. It was obvious </p>
<p>that both good espionage and some very accurate aid to blind bombing </p>
<p>were being employed. Air Vice Marshall Tait concluded this report </p>
<p>with the facetious remark that the Germans must be using something </p>
<p>like Loran.</p>
<p>After concluding our business, John and I went back to my office and </p>
<p>discussed what we had heard. We thought that we knew at least the </p>
<p>general characteristics of both Allied and German radio aids to </p>
<p>navigation. The Germans, we felt sure, had not changed from their </p>
<p>primary dependence upon directional systems. Some of these were very </p>
<p>well instrumented and fairly accurate, but we believed that they </p>
<p>could not, from bases across the English Channel, yield the </p>
<p>precision that Air Vice Marshal Tait had reported. Gee itself was </p>
<p>the only passive British system that would have the accuracy </p>
<p>claimed; "passive" means not requiring radio transmission from the </p>
<p>air craft being guided. By the end of the day, John and I had pretty </p>
<p>well convinced ourselves that the Germans must be using Gee at least </p>
<p>in their pathfinder aircraft.</p>
<p>Use of enemy aids to navigation was by no means unknown. Throughout </p>
<p>most of the war, the British made excellent use of a German </p>
<p>directional system, Sonne, called Consol by the British and further </p>
<p>disguised as Consolan when it was later tried out experimentally in </p>
<p>the United States. This was an accurate medium-range system that was </p>
<p>very easy to use. The Germans had operated it for blind bombing over </p>
<p>much of the British Isles until its usefulness was destroyed by </p>
<p>meaconing, a subtle form of jamming that was hard to detect but </p>
<p>which ruined the accuracy of the system. At the same time, the </p>
<p>British had found Sonne to be very useful in the seas around the </p>
<p>British Isles and in the Bay of Biscay, and they meaconed the system </p>
<p>very gently so that it would be untrustworthy over land but still </p>
<p>good at sea. In fact the utility of Sonne to the allies was so great </p>
<p>that in the latter stages of the war, when some of the Sonne </p>
<p>stations were captured, British crews were assigned to keep them in </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="sonne">Sonne</a></b> 182</p>
<p>operation.</p>
<p>There were two stories, possibly both apochryphal, current in </p>
<p>England about the meaconing of Sonne's predecessor system, Elektra. </p>
<p>The best known was that once the German beams were bent so that a </p>
<p>large raid aimed at one of the Midland cities actually attacked </p>
<p>Dublin. It was of course claimed that the Irish believed the </p>
<p>English, in this case, to have known exactly what they were doing. </p>
<p>Such delicate misadjustment of an enemy system was not technically </p>
<p>feasible, as was proved by the second tale which I happened to hear </p>
<p>by fortuitously being at the right place at the right time. This </p>
<p>tale neutralized the other by stating that a massive German raid had </p>
<p>been diverted from its target but accidentally guided so that it </p>
<p>destroyed one of the biggest ammunition dumps in England.</p>
<p>In the case of Gee, which had been in use as far as the Ruhr since </p>
<p>1942, the Germans had found it possible to jam the signals over </p>
<p>Germany and the occupied territories in the west. The system was </p>
<p>maintained thereafter primarily because it provided highly-reliable </p>
<p>guidance for British bombers returning from raids over Europe, </p>
<p>making operations safe in weather that would otherwise have made </p>
<p>navigation impossible. In 1944 the system was magnificent over </p>
<p>England although of relatively little use elsewhere.</p>
<p>John knew that more than 2,000 aircraft equipped with Gee had been </p>
<p>shot down over the continent. It seemed likely that at least one or </p>
<p>two percent of these sets might have come down in repairable condi </p>
<p>tion. If this had happened, it appeared possible that the Germans </p>
<p>might have installed some in their bombers (or pathfinders) in the </p>
<p>hope that serious damage might be done before the trick could be </p>
<p>discovered. This argument, coupled with the fact that we knew of </p>
<p>nothing else (except certain active systems whose use would have </p>
<p>been revealed by their signals) that could give the observed </p>
<p>accuracy over England, quite convinced us that this use of Gee must </p>
<p>explain the recent flurry of German bomber activity.</p>
<p>Our feeling that we ought to do something useful with this idea was </p>
<p>somewhat dampened by John's recognition of his position. The Tele </p>
<p>communications Research Establishment operated in a quasi-military </p>
<p>mode in which John was, if my memory can be trusted, an equivalent </p>
<p>Flight Lieutenant. He could foresee dreadful consequences if he did </p>
<p>more than report our hypothesis to his immediate superior. I was, on </p>
<p>the other hand, loosely attached to the American Embassy and had no </p>
<p>direct superior in England who could forbid my doing anything that </p>
<p>seemed to me to be useful. The results of these realizations were </p>
<p>that John went back to his proper duties in Malvern while I prepared </p>
<p>to see if I could convince the Royal Air Force that they ought to do </p>
<p>something about the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="gee">German Use of Gee</b> </a>183</p>
<p>I spent the following day, Wednesday, February 23rd, making myself </p>
<p>obnoxious in every office in the Air Ministry that I could reach. My </p>
<p>object was to beg the authorities to shut down the Gee system for an </p>
<p>hour or two during the next German raid, unless a major British </p>
<p>force happened to be returning at the same time. I reasoned that the </p>
<p>pattern of the fall of bombs would immediately reveal whether or not </p>
<p>Gee had been guiding the German aircraft. I met, of course, with </p>
<p>unhesitating refusal on every attempt. The attitude was usually one </p>
<p>of contempt based on the idea that "We would know if they were </p>
<p>trying anything like that". I would answer, "Why, you [expletives </p>
<p>suppressed]! Have you recently shot down a German pathfinder?" This </p>
<p>would bring the answer, "Well, no, we haven't; but we'd know, we'd </p>
<p>know". My only satisfaction during the entire day was to sit beside </p>
<p>the Group Captain in charge of the wreckage of German aircraft while </p>
<p>he, at my insistence, called all of his depots to order an </p>
<p>especially careful search for anything that might have been a Gee </p>
<p>receiver. I returned to my office with the feeling of total defeat </p>
<p>that often followed upon a conference with our British allies.</p>
<p>The next day happened to be the one on which I left for Edinburgh </p>
<p>and Rosyth Halt to join the survey ship for the Loran trials I have </p>
<p>already mentioned. I was therefore out of touch with affairs for a </p>
<p>week or more. On my return to London I found a number of urgent </p>
<p>messages calling me to the Air Ministry. When I visited Air Vice </p>
<p>Marshal Tait the next morning I received a greeting that was unique </p>
<p>in its warmth. It was disclosed that on Thursday, February 24th, the </p>
<p>day following my bad time in Whitehall, a German bomber containing a </p>
<p>Gee receiver had been shot down. I doubt that I ever again had such </p>
<p>a prompt and satisfying fulfillment of a prediction. Before my </p>
<p>return to London, the coding delays (which controlled the geographic </p>
<p>locations of the numbered lines of position in the Gee system) had </p>
<p>been changed, showing the Germans that the British had discovered </p>
<p>their trick; and the baby blitz had already come to a quick end as </p>
<p>the frequency of German raids fell back to the earlier pattern.</p>
<p>Air Vice Marshal Tait rewarded me with an excellent luncheon with </p>
<p>some of the high brass in the Air Force, but he carefully refrained </p>
<p>from giving me any written evidence of this episode. Some months </p>
<p>later, John Bellringer found a chance to clip out one of the </p>
<p>electronic components of this first twice-shot-down Gee set so that </p>
<p>he could send me what has remained one of my favorite souvenirs.</p>
<p>I have always been pleased at the recollection of this event because </p>
<p>the raids had been killing from 100 to 200 people each night. I </p>
<p>reasoned that my interference had presumably advanced the end of the </p>
<p>little blitz by at least a few days, and that I could enjoy the warm </p>
<p>feeling that a few hundred threatened people were still alive.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On one of the rare bright mornings in London in early March I </p>
<p>happened to be on Oxford Street just before nine o'clock. As the </p>
<p>sound of aircraft grew to unprecedented proportions, at least for </p>
<p>me,. I looked up to see the beginning of a flight of fully a </p>
<p>thousand American bombers moving steadily eastward with its center </p>
<p>precisely overhead; no doubt by design. I was duly impressed by the </p>
<p>sight of more aircraft than I had ever seen in one mass, even in a </p>
<p>newsreel.</p>
<p>What moved me, and made the occasion truly memorable, was to look </p>
<p>around and discover the looks of joy, and even glee, on every face </p>
<p>in the street. It was all too clear that every thought had to be, </p>
<p>"Thank heaven, `Jerry' is going to get what he deserves!"</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>At about this same time, pursuant upon a visit to the London Zoo, my </p>
<p>secretary and I conceived a scheme that amused us. Although the </p>
<p>project never came to fruition, the memorandum we drafted may be </p>
<p>worth quoting as it somehow helps to indicate our sentiments on </p>
<p>being confined in London in the wartime winter:</p>
<p>"From: Betty Cooper, OSRD London Mission </p>
<p>To: All Americans connected (however remotely) with the Embassy</p>
<p>1. It has been observed, with keen regret and dismay, that, whereas </p>
<p>many or most of the animals, birds, and reptiles in the London </p>
<p>Zoological Park have been adopted for the duration of the War by </p>
<p>various public-spirited individuals and groups, there is a single </p>
<p>and magnificent specimen of the American Bald Eagle which is, </p>
<p>even at this late date, apparently an orphan.</p>
<p>2. It has been determined that a necessary component of the act of </p>
<p>adoption, in this connection, is the payment of the sum of _____ </p>
<p>Pounds to ______ , or of the guarantee of the payment of _____ </p>
<p>Pounds at ______ intervals.</p>
<p>3. Consummation of the act of adoption is indicated by the </p>
<p>attachment, to the enclosure containing the animal, bird, </p>
<p>reptile, or, in this case, Emblem in question, of a small sign, </p>
<p>usually inscribed in the English language, indicating the fact of </p>
<p>adoption and designating the foster parent, parents, guardian, or </p>
<p>guardians, as the case may be.</p>
<p>4. It is believed that official members of the American colony in </p>
<p>London cannot stand idly by while so great an Emblem of our </p>
<p>national being is allowed to exist in a state of shame and </p>
<p>degradation, being fed) no doubt, upon scraps and remnants </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Promotion">The Eagle / Promotion</b> </a>185</p>
<p>considered unfit for the consumption of his already-adopted </p>
<p>neighbors, among whom may be observed the lowly vulture, condor, </p>
<p>and sea-eagle.</p>
<p>5. It is therefore proposed that each of those who feel the need for </p>
<p>action in this matter should contribute a sum, proportionate to </p>
<p>the depth of his emotion, toward the adoption of this noble </p>
<p>Emblem of our Freedom who finds himself, like so many of us, </p>
<p>constrained to dwell, through no fault of his own, in an allied, </p>
<p>yet alien, land.</p>
<p>We might have carried forward the Eagle Project except that just </p>
<p>then Dr. DuBridge, the Director of the Radiation Laboratory, and Dr. </p>
<p>Compton, the President of M.I.T., passed through London on a trip to </p>
<p>visit various laboratories and authorities in England. They brought </p>
<p>the news that Curry Street was about to come to England as the new </p>
<p>head of the BBRL, the British Branch of the Radiation Laboratory, </p>
<p>while I was to become the head of the Loran Division. This meant </p>
<p>that my first duty was to get home, a very welcome idea, so that I </p>
<p>could confer with Curry for at least a few days before he moved to </p>
<p>England.</p>
<p>I felt that I would at first be good for little if I flew home in </p>
<p>the tail of a military aircraft, the usual way for Rad Lab people to </p>
<p>travel, so I insisted that Betty and I should be treated to a </p>
<p>commercial flight on one of the old Pan Am flying boats. To my </p>
<p>surprise, no one objected to this plan which would cost, I remember, </p>
<p>209 pounds 16 shillings (about $850) each for the one-way fare. It </p>
<p>still being the winter season when the flying boats could not carry </p>
<p>enough fuel for safety on the North Atlantic direct route, we </p>
<p>would fly south to Dakar and across the shortest stretch between </p>
<p>Africa and Brazil. Almost everything about this trip turned out to </p>
<p>be pleasant or amusing.</p>
<p>The first curious happening was an introduction to my most unusual </p>
<p>banking transaction. I had arranged by telephone for BBRL, which </p>
<p>disbursed my expense money, to send me a check to cover the two </p>
<p>airplane fares. When the check did not arrive in the first mail the </p>
<p>next morning (the British Post Office being, then at least, uniquely </p>
<p>efficient), I telephoned to Malvern to find out what was wrong. It </p>
<p>as explained that the Lab had changed its mind and simply told the </p>
<p>Malvern branch of the Midland Bank to have a London office give me </p>
<p>the money in cash. This sounded odd to me but there was no </p>
<p>alternative in the time available, so I walked a couple of blocks to </p>
<p>the branch bank in Oxford Street. Not knowing what to try first, I </p>
<p>simply went to the nearest teller and began negotiations, saying, </p>
<p>"My name is Pierce - ". "Oh, yes, Mr. Pierce", said the teller and </p>
<p>immediately began counting out a pile of five-pound notes about an </p>
<p>inch thick. At the end he tossed a few pound notes and some silver </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="homeward">The Homeward Trip</b> </a>186</p>
<p>on top and pushed it toward me, saying, "Thank you, sir" and turned </p>
<p>to go about some other duty. As he did not seem interested in having </p>
<p>me sign a receipt, I took the money and went to the Pan American </p>
<p>office and bought our tickets.</p>
<p>We left London early on a Sunday morning in March on a flight that </p>
<p>brought us to Shannon in Ireland in good time for lunch at the </p>
<p>airport restaurant. This was the first of three meals that were </p>
<p>highly memorable after the terrible diet in London. Shannon provided </p>
<p>a magnificent platter of sliced cold turkey and ham with a delicious </p>
<p>salad and other goodies we had not had for months. After lunch we </p>
<p>were driven thirty or forty miles through Limerick to Foynes, a </p>
<p>village on the south side of the Shannon where the river was several </p>
<p>miles wide and provided an excellent sheltered landing place for the </p>
<p>flying boats. Here we had to wait several hours before leaving for </p>
<p>Lisbon, because Pan American had had an aircraft shot down on that </p>
<p>route a few weeks before. As a consequence, the flights then left </p>
<p>Foynes only after dark.</p>
<p>We promptly met three other passengers for New York. With them we </p>
<p>made a walking tour of the village, an enterprise that took only a </p>
<p>few minutes. Observing that nearly half of the buildings were pubs, </p>
<p>we decided to investigate what was reputed to keep the Irish poor </p>
<p>and selected one for examination. The fact that the wall behind the </p>
<p>bar was completely covered by shelves full of bottles of John </p>
<p>Jamison's failed to make me realize that I was no longer in England, </p>
<p>so I automatically asked for a double whisky. The bartender </p>
<p>selected a sixteen-ounce glass and filled it with whisky to within </p>
<p>an inch of the top. He added a splash of soda and then handed it to </p>
<p>me. I nursed this noble drink for the balance of the afternoon and </p>
<p>managed to maintain consciousness until it was time to report to the </p>
<p>aircraft.</p>
<p>We found that the five who had assembled at Foynes were the only </p>
<p>passengers on the aircraft until we reached Puerto Rico, after which </p>
<p>it was crowded. As a result, for most of the trip the plane had </p>
<p>almost the spacious atmosphere of a ship and we could doze or read </p>
<p>without discomfort or walk about freely when we wished. Soon after </p>
<p>we reached cruising altitude the steward produced excellent steaks </p>
<p>and even baked potatoes, to the great satisfaction of all </p>
<p>passengers. We reached the Tagus River at about one in the morning. </p>
<p>Although it took two hours or more to get the plane ready for the </p>
<p>next leg of the trip, there was not time to go to Lisbon itself. We </p>
<p>were taken to a small restaurant building for what I suppose must </p>
<p>have been regarded as breakfast. We distributed ourselves around a </p>
<p>table that would have accomodated a full set of passengers and </p>
<p>started to sample thousands of olives and a few bottles of rather </p>
<p>sour red wine. As soon as the waitress saw us seated, she brought in </p>
<p>a platter that could have held a large turkey but was piled high </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Homeward Trip, continued 187</p>
<p>with scrambled eggs and bacon. Because none of us had seen such a </p>
<p>beautiful sight for a long time, we five managed to empty the </p>
<p>platter quite quickly. When the waitress next came in she looked a </p>
<p>bit surprised but took away the platter and brought another equally </p>
<p>loaded with scrambled eggs, but this time fully decorated with </p>
<p>sausages. We eventually got back into the plane well distended and </p>
<p>ready to sleep.</p>
<p>When we awoke we were flying across the western part of the Spanish </p>
<p>Sahara. It was, in fact, remarkably beautiful but we were very </p>
<p>conscious of the hope that we might not have trouble and need to </p>
<p>come down there. The middle of the day brought us to Dakar where we </p>
<p>were given lunch in an American Naval mess. This broke the series of </p>
<p>enjoyable meals. It was the worst I ever ate in a military </p>
<p>establishment; about as bad as a few of those in Ak-Bulak. After a </p>
<p>sight-seeing drive around Dakar in the afternoon, where it was </p>
<p>interesting to see the Arabian costumes in a city where the signs </p>
<p>were in French, we left for Brazil in the evening. In this case, I </p>
<p>think, the late departure was primarily so that we could use the </p>
<p>stars for navigation, Loran not having penetrated into that part of </p>
<p>the world. After breakfast in Natal we flew to Belem, this leg of </p>
<p>the trip taking us over the tropical jungle. This reminded us of the </p>
<p>Sahara as it also was beautiful but by no means a place where we </p>
<p>would wish to land. The heat and steady rain in Belem discouraged us </p>
<p>from trying to do anything except wait for the plane to be ready to </p>
<p>fly.</p>
<p>After leaving Belem we passed over the mouth of the Amazon where we </p>
<p>were, for some time, out of sight of land. Arriving in Port of </p>
<p>Spain, Trinidad, in the evening we were greeted with trays of </p>
<p>Planter's Punch and taken to the Queen's Park Hotel (where I had </p>
<p>bought Catherine's cologne three years before) for baths and a </p>
<p>night's sleep in a real bed. The bed was satisfactory although I </p>
<p>slept with a mosquito obligato from the insects trying to find a </p>
<p>hole in the netting; but the bath turned out to be imaginary as </p>
<p>there was a water shortage and the service had been discontinued </p>
<p>just as we arrived. I still wonder how turning off the water in the </p>
<p>middle of the night could be supposed to be much of a conservation </p>
<p>measure.</p>
<p>I was amused at the antics of our flying boat in trying to get off </p>
<p>the water in the Dragon's Mouth. We left Port of Spain downwind and </p>
<p>needed to turn before takeoff. A strong wind was against us as we </p>
<p>turned and the downwind wing tried to droop into the water. The </p>
<p>pilot made several unsuccessful variations of the maneuver, </p>
<p>sometimes trying to go very slowly to turn before the wind noticed </p>
<p>him, and at other times trying at high speed, so that the ailerons </p>
<p>would give him more lateral control. We began to worry a little, as </p>
<p>each trial seemed to use up a half mile of distance and the crags of </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Homeward Trip, continued 188</p>
<p>Venezuela were getting closer. Finally, at what I guessed was a half </p>
<p>mile from the rocks, the turn was completed successfully and we were </p>
<p>off across the Caribbean.</p>
<p>At San Juan the plane filled up with Puerto Ricans and, in the </p>
<p>latter part of the night, brought us to Bermuda. We landed in New </p>
<p>York on Thursday, a few hours more than four days after leaving </p>
<p>London. I finally reached home with a serious problem for Catherine, </p>
<p>as I think I had amassed twenty-six dirty shirts and the wartime </p>
<p>problems had just made our laundry cross us off their list of </p>
<p>customers. Even with this and other minor difficulties, it was a </p>
<p>delight to be home again.</p>
<p>Our trip had covered more than 10,000 miles at a speed of about 120 </p>
<p>knots. Later I calculated that, in terms of the airline distance </p>
<p>from London to Boston, we had averaged thirty-one miles per hour </p>
<p>toward home!</p>

<b><p><a name="variants">Variants of Loran</a></p>
</b><p>My transition to Division Head was made easily, because everyone in </p>
<p>the Loran work had settled into whatever job he could do best, and </p>
<p>because the division's administrative assistant, John Halford (a </p>
<p>business man and wool expert), had all our affairs under good </p>
<p>control. John always seemed to know what would be needed and </p>
<p>maintained beautiful files that answered almost all questions at </p>
<p>once - a talent that I lacked and sorely needed. The division had by </p>
<p>this time reached its stable maximum size of about seventy-five </p>
<p>people. Although I have nothing but respect for the abilities of </p>
<p>physicists, I have always thought that the success of Division 11 </p>
<p>(and perhaps especially the speed at which it was able to operate) </p>
<p>was due to the mixture of the many talents of its members. The radar </p>
<p>development and the search for the atomic bomb had drawn off the </p>
<p>most talented physicists. Division 11, because it was organized a </p>
<p>few months later than those efforts, and also because Melville </p>
<p>Eastham was an intensely practical man, called heavily upon the </p>
<p>skills of various kinds of engineers and other sorts of experts. As </p>
<p>a result, whenever a problem arose there always seemed to be someone </p>
<p>in the group who could deal with it.</p>
<p>The first few months after my return were devoted largely to a crash </p>
<p>program that did not have my complete sympathy. The Army Air Force </p>
<p>had convinced the division that it should develop a tactical form </p>
<p>called Air-Transportable Loran that could be installed quickly in </p>
<p>the field and, when necessary, could have its stations moved from </p>
<p>time to time. This was wanted primarily for the China-Burma-India </p>
<p>region. This effort required three main developments: new and semi-</p>
<p>automatic synchronizing devices, light-weight transmitters, and </p>
<p>simplified methods for calculating lines of position and plotting </p>
<p>them on charts.</p>
<p>The synchronization was established, mostly by Jack Williams and </p>
<p>Glenn Musselman (who had come to us after experience helping Major </p>
<p>Armstrong in the development of wideband FM), by adding automatic </p>
<p>control circuits to navigational receivers. These circuits, with </p>
<p>some modifications to improve accuracy and stability, made it </p>
<p>possible for a slave station to maintain its phase with relatively </p>
<p>little operator attention. Al Pote' and Dick Lawrence designed and </p>
<p>built very pretty transmitters of about one-tenth the size and </p>
<p>weight of the standard ones. Unfortunately, the power was reduced to </p>
<p>half or a little less, with the result that these transmitters were </p>
<p>never used in the field as the Army Air Force decided to fly in </p>
<p>standard transmitters for the sake of the extra power. So far as </p>
<p>equipment went, the Rad Lab might as well have saved its efforts </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>190</p>
<p>because standard transmitter timers could have been used instead of </p>
<p>the air-transportable ones with little extra effort on the part of </p>
<p>the Air Force.</p>
<p>The real success of the AT program was in the development of simple </p>
<p>calculating methods and in the training of dozens of young Air Force </p>
<p>officers for the field production of charts. This effort made </p>
<p>possible the use in Asia of ten or a dozen Loran stations under </p>
<p>circumstances that did not often permit time for the production of </p>
<p>the regular Hydrographic Office charts. As an additional benefit, </p>
<p>the Army Air Force could have Loran lines on its normal aeronautical </p>
<p>charts that were drawn in a different scale and style from the Navy </p>
<p>charts.</p>
<p>These achievements, and others, must be credited entirely to </p>
<p>Professor Bancroft W. Sitterly, an astronomer who had come to us </p>
<p>from Wesleyan University. Dr. Sitterly was not only an able </p>
<p>astronomer and mathematician but also probably the best teacher I </p>
<p>ever knew. I have always felt that he could be trusted to teach </p>
<p>anything to anyone. During the time when I was in England, Banny had </p>
<p>completed a short text called The Elements of Loran. This has never </p>
<p>been equalled as an introduction to the theory and practice of the </p>
<p>new system. It was published as a Rad Lab report in March, 1944, and </p>
<p>republished within a month by the U.S. Navy which distributed </p>
<p>thousands of copies. In late 1944 Catherine and I gave our son the </p>
<p>middle name of Bancroft, largely in Banny's honor.</p>
<p>A difficulty with Loran resulted from the normal errors of celestial </p>
<p>methods for determining the geographic positions of transmitters and </p>
<p>the general inaccuracy of charts, particularly in the higher </p>
<p>latitudes. The combination of these troubles sometimes resulted in </p>
<p>errors of a mile or two (or occasionally half a dozen miles in the </p>
<p>Arctic). It remained a nagging problem how to correct the Loran </p>
<p>lines to agree with charts that were known to be inaccurate. The </p>
<p>dilemma had to be resolved in favor of forcing agreement with the </p>
<p>standard charts because the overriding requirement was to bring the </p>
<p>navigator to the place he was trying to find. These difficulties </p>
<p>were increased in the AT Loran operation because the baselines, were </p>
<p>generally very short and so the geometrical contributions to errors </p>
<p>were large. Banny made a very thorough study of these effects, with </p>
<p>the result that a few observations of discrepancies between the </p>
<p>chart and the terrain could be used to deduce approximate </p>
<p>corrections for the entire coverage area of a group of stations. </p>
<p>These methods became a part of the AT Loran charting program, and </p>
<p>Banny taught them to many Air Force officers who used them to great </p>
<p>advantage in the last year of the war against Japan.</p>
</font><p><hr>
<font face="Courier New" size="2"><p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="AT">AT Loran</b> </a>191</p>
<p>For some time I had been wondering whether the Loran technique could </p>
<p>be used at a lower radio frequency. This possibility appeared </p>
<p>important because of the large distances between some of the island </p>
<p>groups in the Pacific Ocean. It seemed likely that an attack on the </p>
<p>Japanese homeland, which it was generally thought would be </p>
<p>necessary, could not be well served by Loran when operated at a </p>
<p>frequency of two megahertz. At a lower frequency the measurement of </p>
<p>time difference could not be as good, but the experienoe with SS</p>
<p>Loran had taught us the advantages of a longer baseline, which might </p>
<p>go far toward making up for decreased accuracy of measurement. Of </p>
<p>primary importance was the expectation that we might be able to </p>
<p>double the distances served by Loran.</p>
<p>My new position gave me a seat on the Steering Committee of the </p>
<p>Radiation Laboratory. I could, of course, contribute little to the </p>
<p>discussions and decisions about problems and proposals for microwave </p>
<p>radar systems. On the other hand, no one else on the Steering </p>
<p>Committee had much understanding of Loran. It was therefore </p>
<p>relatively easy to get approval for anything in which I believed </p>
<p>strongly. I soon secured an allocation of about two million dollars </p>
<p>for the work on Low Frequency Loran. I found that my efforts to </p>
<p>spend this money wisely, in spite of the need for speed, made this </p>
<p>the hardest administrative job I could imagine. It did, in fact, </p>
<p>give me a permanent distaste for the business side of research.</p>
<p>By the autumn of 1944 our commitments to AT Loran were largely </p>
<p>completed and I could get more and more people into the LF work. We </p>
<p>were able to use somewhat more professional methods than time had </p>
<p>permitted in the original Loran design. For example, the standard </p>
<p>Loran transmitters were simple high-powered oscillators, turned on </p>
<p>or "modulated" by short driving pulses at the right instants. This </p>
<p>caused no trouble because the radio-frequency period was only about </p>
<p>half a microsecond while the typical measurement error was about </p>
<p>twice that value. The phase of the radio frequency was therefore of </p>
<p>no importance. At the low frequency we ultimately decided on, 180 </p>
<p>kilohertz, the period was about five and a half microseconds or </p>
<p>considerably more than we hoped the the normal error would be. It </p>
<p>was therefore necessary, or at least advisable, to use a crystal </p>
<p>controlled source of' the radio frequency that would be coherent </p>
<p>with the pulse repetition frequency, so that each radio-frequency </p>
<p>cycle could have its standard position within the pulse envelope. </p>
<p>This would have been good engineering practice in standard Loran but </p>
<p>could be neglected without harm in that case. The use of this </p>
<p>technique required a development of new methods for deriving and </p>
<p>modulating the carrier frequency.</p>
<p>This "phase coherence" also made it possible to make more accurate </p>
<p>measurements by comparing the timing of individual radio-frequency </p>
<p>cycles as well as the time of arrival of the pulse envelope. Thus we </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="LF">LF Loran</b> </a>192</p>
<p>could have a coarse and a fine measurement because the pulse </p>
<p>envelope would, we hoped, be stable enough to identify a particular </p>
<p>radio-frequency cycle (as, for example, the third or fourth visible </p>
<p>one, or perhaps one at a certain fraction of the maximum height of </p>
<p>the pulse) while the exact reading was made on the rf cycle itself. </p>
<p>This technique turned out to be difficult to handle with high </p>
<p>reliability in a navigator's receiver, but it was used successfully </p>
<p>from the first in holding synchronism between the transmitting </p>
<p>stations. We believed that we were able to maintain the relative </p>
<p>timing to about a tenth of a microsecond.</p>
<p>We also made a number of other improvements in technique, such as </p>
<p>elegant attenuators for the transmitting stations, to reduce the </p>
<p>over-powering local signal in the receivers. These gave very great </p>
<p>attenuation at the right instants without incurring noticeable phase </p>
<p>shifts on the distant signals. Another important device for </p>
<p>preventing interference from the locally-generated carrier was a </p>
<p>modulation system that guaranteed the total absence of the carrier </p>
<p>between pulses.</p>
<p>The problem of receivers for the Low Frequency Loran system was </p>
<p>temporarily solved by the construction of small converters that </p>
<p>would translate the low-frequency signals to one of the Standard </p>
<p>Loran frequencies so that existing receiver-indicators could be </p>
<p>used. This technique was possible because all of the timing </p>
<p>characteristics were the same at the two frequencies except that, at </p>
<p>the low frequency it would be possible to have one master and two or </p>
<p>even more slave stations operate at each recurrence rate. The </p>
<p>converters were unfortunately manufactured with too narrow a </p>
<p>bandwidth, which turned out to be a limiting factor in the accuracy </p>
<p>that could be achieved.</p>
<p>Transmitting antennas for the low frequency constituted a major </p>
<p>problem. We designed and ordered for use in the Pacific three 625-</p>
<p>foot lattice towers to be used in an "umbrella" configuration with </p>
<p>heavy toploading cables. These could not be produced quickly so we </p>
<p>settled for balloon-supported wires for the experimental stations </p>
<p>set up in the United States. The balloons were little "VLA" (very </p>
<p>low altitude) models about 35 feet in length and with a diameter of </p>
<p>114 feet. They had stabilizing fins so that the kite effect gave </p>
<p>them some additional lift from the prevailing winds. Each balloon </p>
<p>supported an antenna of about 1300 feet of copperweld wire with </p>
<p>large insulators at the top and bottom. The Army Air Force provided </p>
<p>the balloons and helium to fill them, and also assigned small crews </p>
<p>to fly them for us. We had three stations at East Brewster, </p>
<p>Massachusetts; Cape Fear, North Carolina; and Key Largo, Florida.</p>
<p>The balloons flew more reliably than we had dared to hope but, of </p>
<p>course, were less than perfect. They had a maximum load-carrying </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="LFTEchniques">LF Loran Techniques</b> </a>193</p>
<p>capacity (in still air) of 58 pounds while our antenna wire and </p>
<p>insulators weighed 48 pounds. It was therefore essential to keep the </p>
<p>balloons well inflated. It surprised me that, even with the balloons </p>
<p>flying in three quite different weather patterns, all three of them </p>
<p>were in the air for more than ninety percent of the time. This would </p>
<p>not have been satisfactory for operational use, where absolute </p>
<p>reliability of the signals is highly desirable, but it was adequate </p>
<p>for the experimental work.</p>
<p>Our continuing attempts to keep the balloons flying as much as we </p>
<p>could led us into interesting quandaries. It was impossible to reel </p>
<p>in a balloon and land it safely at a wind speed of more than 20 or </p>
<p>25 miles per hour, but the strength of our antenna wire was adequate </p>
<p>to permit the balloons to fly in winds up to 140 or 50 miles per </p>
<p>hour. Whenever a high wind was predicted we had to guess how extreme </p>
<p>it might become and try to get the balloon down, if necessary, at </p>
<p>the last possible moment. If we guessed wrong and the balloon </p>
<p>carried away it became embarrassing because we had to alert the Air </p>
<p>Force to get out planes to shoot the balloon down before it became </p>
<p>too much of a hazard to aviation. There was also the risk that a </p>
<p>trailing piece of antenna wire might short-circuit electric </p>
<p>transmission lines in the neighborhood but, so far as I know, this </p>
<p>never happened. We lost several balloons in the months the trial </p>
<p>system lasted, but none of them caused serious trouble. </p>
<p>One night the balloon at East Brewster was reported to have broken </p>
<p>loose in a high wind at about one o'clock in the morning. I happened </p>
<p>to be staying at Mrs. Consodine's that night. While driving out to </p>
<p>the station at about eight o'clock in the morning, I was amazed to </p>
<p>see the missing balloon floating peacefully within a couple of miles </p>
<p>of the station at what I guessed was a five or six thousand foot </p>
<p>altitude. It was inconceivable that the wind could have shifted to </p>
<p>bring the balloon back so accurately after seven hours, but the </p>
<p>anomaly was never explained. I can only suppose that whatever </p>
<p>antenna wire was torn loose with the balloon must have caught in a </p>
<p>tree until the rising sun heated the helium and increased the lift </p>
<p>enough to let the balloon break free.</p>
<p>On another occasion the balloon at East Brewster gave me an eerie </p>
<p>sensation that all the laws of physics were being flouted. It was </p>
<p>late on a dark night when I walked out to the balloon's tie point to </p>
<p>make some change in the antenna coupling network. As the 1300-foot </p>
<p>antenna could accumulate enormous static charges, the first duty in </p>
<p>making such an adjustment was to ground the antenna above the bottom </p>
<p>insulator through a length of copper braid attached to a hook with </p>
<p>an insulated handle. The insulator at the bottom of the antenna was </p>
<p>suspended at a height of four or five feet. When I attached the hook </p>
<p>and ground strap, which together probably weighed a pound or two, </p>
<p>the whole structure of balloon, wire, and ground strap slowly </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="balloonanecdotes">Balloon Anecdotes</b> </a>194</p>
<p>settled down until the insulator rested on the ground. At this point </p>
<p>I realized that it was a perfectly still night with no wind strain </p>
<p>on the antenna. I made a mental note that there seemed to be no </p>
<p>excess lift and that we would have to add helium in the morning, and </p>
<p>then went on to make the necessary change in the coupling network. </p>
<p>After finishing this I removed the ground strap and, to my surprise, </p>
<p>found that the insulator continued to rest on the ground. In a pure </p>
<p>spirit of fun I grasped the long insulator by the safe end and </p>
<p>hoisted it up to its normal position where, to my complete </p>
<p>amazement, it remained. This behavior seemed totally unreal as the </p>
<p>balloon could not possibly be in such exact neutral buoyancy, and I </p>
<p>actually felt the hair rise on the nape of my neck. Upon later </p>
<p>consideration I decided that just as I raised the insulator a faint </p>
<p>breeze must have caught the balloon so that the kiting effect </p>
<p>increased the lift by at least the weight of the insulator; but at </p>
<p>the time I surely felt that some unknown power must be at work.</p>
<p>The Brewster low frequency station operated from late 1944 for </p>
<p>trials of developing equipment, but the three-station network was </p>
<p>available only from April to September, 1945. We made fixed-station </p>
<p>observations during this period at various points between Minnesota </p>
<p>and Trinidad and the Azores with fair success, although the accuracy </p>
<p>of the system was not as good as we had hoped that it would be. The </p>
<p>Signal Corps also made even more extensive observations at a number </p>
<p>of places. By the time the trials ended we believed that our steel </p>
<p>towers would be delivered and all necessary equipment ready to ship </p>
<p>within two months, when the end of the war brought the whole project </p>
<p>to a quick stop.</p>
<p>I had a pleasant but unsuccessful idea in July of 1945. A total </p>
<p>solar eclipse was to cross western Canada and I thought it would be </p>
<p>great fun to walk unannounced into the camp of Don Menzel who had </p>
<p>led the 1936 expedition and who, I had heard, was to observe the </p>
<p>1945 eclipse at a small town in Saskatchewan. It happened that we </p>
<p>wanted to test the LF Loran signals in an airplane at about that </p>
<p>distance from the east coast, so I timed the trip to accomplish both </p>
<p>objectives. At Regina I talked some RCAF officers into taking a </p>
<p>staff car a hundred miles or so to the town of Bradenbury, where we </p>
<p>would spend the night as the eclipse would pass early in the </p>
<p>morning. My timing was perfect and I called on Don in the evening </p>
<p>before the event but, as I should have predicted, he was so busy </p>
<p>that he hardly noticed my being there. In the morning we rose to </p>
<p>find a patch of cloud, about twenty miles across, neatly centered </p>
<p>above the camp. The clouds remained between us and the sun until </p>
<p>after the end of the eclipse. We nevertheless were treated to a most </p>
<p>beautiful sight as there was a brilliant orange light all around the </p>
<p>horizon during the eclipse. This light reflected from the bottoms of </p>
<p>the clouds, turning the parts between the bright spots a deep purple </p>
<p>by contrast. The effect was rather like golden moonlight on purple </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="firstcycle">The First Cycle Matching</b> </a>195</p>
<p>water, but upside down. Our disappointment was accentuated when we </p>
<p>found later that we had been under the only patch of clouds along </p>
<p>the eclipse track; if we had chosen any other place we could have </p>
<p>seen it perfectly. Fortunately, the LF Loran experiment on the </p>
<p>flight was entirely successful.</p>
<p>We had had no hope of getting special "cycle-matching" receivers </p>
<p>into production and use for many months, but Glenn Musselman and I </p>
<p>had been working on such a device for some time and had, before the </p>
<p>end of the war, built two or three models. These receivers were </p>
<p>intended to make very accurate measurements at distances short </p>
<p>enough so that the groundwave pulse was usable in the few cycles </p>
<p>that arrived before being jammed by the stronger and later-arriving </p>
<p>sky waves. It was uncertain whether the correct cycle could be </p>
<p>recognized among its very similar neighbors, a matter that could be </p>
<p>settled only by experiment. We took one of these receivers to </p>
<p>Bermuda for tests just at the end of the war; in fact, the news of </p>
<p>the first atomic bomb reached us as we passed through South Station </p>
<p>on our way to New Jersey to catch an Air Force plane to Bermuda. We </p>
<p>set up our gear quickly and made observations for a week before the </p>
<p>Japanese surrendered and it became our obvious duty to get home </p>
<p>again. These experiments were fairly successful. The station at Key </p>
<p>Largo was about a thousand miles away and yielded very uncertain </p>
<p>cycle identification, but the pair connecting Cape Fear with East </p>
<p>Brewster was much better and we could choose the right cycle about </p>
<p>eighty percent of the time. The accuracy within the cycles was, as </p>
<p>we had expected, about a tenth of a microsecond which gave us a </p>
<p>probable error of about 160 feet in the line of position through our </p>
<p>site in Bermuda. The average position, however, disagreed with the </p>
<p>chart by about 1200 feet. At the time it was uncertain whether this </p>
<p>discrepancy was caused by a calibration error somewhere in our </p>
<p>equipment or a mistake in the charted position of Bermuda. A year or </p>
<p>two later, the question was settled in our favor, as the </p>
<p>Hydrographic Office decided to move Bermuda about a quarter of a </p>
<p>mile on its charts.</p>
<p>The whole experiment indicated that high-precision measurements were </p>
<p>indeed possible but that, as we had expected, the problem of cycle </p>
<p>identification would require more work and especially careful </p>
<p>instrumentation. A dozen years later, this low-frequency system came </p>
<p>back into existence as Loran C, which has now become the normal form </p>
<p>of Loran. Loran C differs from our experiment chiefly in using </p>
<p>multiple pulses from each station and up to 140 times as much power </p>
<p>as we had. These changes operate strongly to bring the weak ground </p>
<p>wave up above the ambient noise to improve the reliability of cycle </p>
<p>identification. This is also aided by the use of a lower carrier </p>
<p>frequency (100 kilohertz) with longer cycles. I regret that in our </p>
<p>reports at the end of the war we did not emphasize the low-frequency </p>
<p>work, preferring to concentrate on the proven performance of </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The First Cycle Matching, continued 196</p>
<p>Standard Loran, later known as Loran A. As a result, almost no one </p>
<p>today knows that the Radiation Laboratory came very close to </p>
<p>bringing cycle-matching to the status of a useful method, and it is </p>
<p>often thought that Loran C was invented by the Coast Guard or </p>
<p>perhaps by the Bureau of Standards, which tried hard to stimulate </p>
<p>interest in that system. Actually, the unique and important </p>
<p>distinguishing features of Loran C were devised by Winslow Palmer, a </p>
<p>very clever engineer from Sperry, who had worked closely with the </p>
<p>Radiation Laboratory people during the war, and who continued for </p>
<p>some years to suggest and experiment with ingenious ways to make </p>
<p>cycle-matching reliable.</p>
<p>On this last trip to Bermuda, we had slept, for some reason, at the </p>
<p>V.I.P. guest house at Kindley Field. Before that airport had been </p>
<p>dredged up from the bottom of the sea this house had been a pleasant </p>
<p>mansion on an island. When the airport had been finished, the house </p>
<p>found itself on a rocky nubbin close to the intersection of the two </p>
<p>major runways. At the time of our visit, there were aircraft </p>
<p>arriving and leaving at five-minute intervals, bringing soldiers </p>
<p>back from Europe for transfer to the Pacific. When departing, these </p>
<p>four-engined transports usually rose to just a little more than the </p>
<p>height of the guest house and thundered past at what seemed to be a </p>
<p>distance of a hundred yards or so. This racket never subsided during </p>
<p>the night, and I was sure that the vibration would soon reduce the </p>
<p>house to rubble. The situation had one minor advantage, however, </p>
<p>because the activity of the aircraft made it easier for us to work </p>
<p>long hours in the hope that we might get tired enough to sleep.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>On my return to Cambridge I found that there were only three duties </p>
<p>left: to terminate all work as quickly as possible; to find jobs for </p>
<p>everyone; and to help write a complete account of the achievements </p>
<p>of the Radiation Laboratory. This last effort resulted in the </p>
<p>publication of the Radiation Laboratory Series of twenty-eight </p>
<p>volumes that recorded the many wartime developments, chiefly in </p>
<p>microwave theory and practice. Dick Woodward and Alexander McKenzie </p>
<p>(whom I had known, at least by radio, since the mountaintop days in </p>
<p>Maine, and who had headed our divisional publications office) and I </p>
<p>were designated the editors of the Loran book, which appeared as </p>
<p>Volume 14 of the series. Until the formal end of the Radiation </p>
<p>Laboratory on December 31st, everyone who could write and who had </p>
<p>not left for other work was kept busy composing this account. As far </p>
<p>as possible, the chapters were written by those most expert in the </p>
<p>various subjects, but a few sections were ghost-written by the </p>
<p>editors in an effort to give credit where it was due in the case of </p>
<p>important contributors to the program who could not or would not </p>
<p>write. The editors were kept on the Rad Lab payroll at half rate for </p>
<p>the first months of 1946 to carry this work forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The First Cycle Matching, continued 197</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the program for finding jobs for people (and particularly </p>
<p>for myself) I conceived the idea that perhaps the Navy might </p>
<p>subsidize our efforts if I brought a number of our Radiation </p>
<p>Laboratoy people to Harvard to use some of our powerful new </p>
<p>techniques in investigation of the physics of the ionosphere. As a </p>
<p>first step in the negotiations I secured an appointment with Admiral </p>
<p>Furer, the head of the Navy's Office of Research and Inventions. I </p>
<p>was greatly surprised to meet, in the admiral's waiting room, </p>
<p>Professor E. L. Chaffee, who had become director of Cruft Laboratory </p>
<p>upon the retirement of Professor G. W. Pierce. Professor Chaffee was </p>
<p>there on much the same mission, but with ideas further matured than </p>
<p>mine. After some three-way discussion, and at Admiral Furer's </p>
<p>suggestion, I fitted myself into Professor Chaffee's proposal for </p>
<p>one of the first university research contracts with the organization </p>
<p>that became, after Admiral Furer had retired, the Office of Naval </p>
<p>Research.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="returntoharvard">Return to Harvard</a></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These negotiations secured a place for me at Harvard which, in </p>
<p>accordance with its normal policy, had not renewed my annual </p>
<p>appointments after I had been on leave for two years. On January 1, </p>
<p>1946, about ten of the Rad Lab people came to Cruft Laboratory. They </p>
<p>were more or less equally divided between full-time research </p>
<p>fellows, students who would work half-time and pursue graduate </p>
<p>degrees, and technicians or research assistants.</p>
<p>In the last months of the Radiation Laboratory we had compiled a </p>
<p>long report on the status of Low Frequency Loran. This was intended </p>
<p>to record all details of design so that other people, if they </p>
<p>wished, could resume the work without any great loss of information. </p>
<p>For some reason the Radiation Laboratory had closed without </p>
<p>publishing this report. One of my first actions at Harvard, </p>
<p>therefore, was to induce the Navy to subsidize the printing of this </p>
<p>report, which was issued from Cruft Laboratory under the curious </p>
<p>title of Radiation Laboratory Report Number 1061 because the Rad Lab </p>
<p>had at least gotten as far as giving it a number that was mentioned </p>
<p>in other publications. The report was unusual because it was the </p>
<p>only technical report in my experience that was printed from hand </p>
<p>set type (possibly because the low bidder was the company that </p>
<p>printed the Boston telephone directories) and was bound in hard </p>
<p>covers.</p>
<p>The completed LF Loran equipment was taken over by the Army Air </p>
<p>Force and our test stations were promptly set up again in southern </p>
<p>Canada. This was, I suppose, primarily an experiment to help </p>
<p>determine the utility of the system. The excuse for the location was </p>
<p>that it would support a military exercise called the MuskOx Project. </p>
<p>This was basically a Canadian test of living and working in the </p>
<p>arctic winter, but it was assisted to some extent by British and </p>
<p>American participants or observers. A group of 50 or 60 people was </p>
<p>to set out from Churchill, on the western side of Hudson's Bay, and </p>
<p>drive north as far as possible and then west along the coast of the </p>
<p>Arctic Ocean to Coppermine and Norman Wells, and thence south to </p>
<p>finish the trip at Edmonton. I believe that two or three kinds of </p>
<p>treaded vehicles were to be used, dragging sleds with supplies of </p>
<p>gasoline and food. There were also some emergency arrangements to </p>
<p>drop additional supplies from aircraft, but it was hoped that the </p>
<p>expedition would be self-sufficient. The trip was to begin in the </p>
<p>middle of February and last nearly three months, covering more than </p>
<p>3,000 miles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>199</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone apparently thought that LF Loran might help the MuskOx </p>
<p>people with their navigation, so the Rad Lab test transmitters, </p>
<p>complete with balloons, were set up in southern Canada. This </p>
<p>subsidiary effort was called, obviously, Musk Calf. Our group had </p>
<p>barely settled at Harvard when we received a last-minute request to </p>
<p>visit the transmitting stations to see that all was in order, </p>
<p>although there was hardly time to do anything in case trouble should </p>
<p>be encountered. As a result, Dave Davidson, Dick Woodward, and I, </p>
<p>supported by one technician, Angelo Pannesi, made a quick start for </p>
<p>Canada, equipped with complete sets of arctic clothing by the Air </p>
<p>Force. Dave and Dick went to the two western stations while Angie </p>
<p>and I settled at Gimli, Manitoba, on Lake Winnipeg. I do not </p>
<p>remember that we found much wrong with the installations, but I am </p>
<p>sure we gave the operators confidence and helped them to get the </p>
<p>signals on the air before the middle of February. I was surprised </p>
<p>and pleased to find that many of the local people were Finns, so </p>
<p>that one or two evenings at a local restaurant and dancehall had </p>
<p>much of the flavor of nights at cabarets in their old country.</p>
<p>While preparing for the trip I had done my best to calculate the sky </p>
<p>wave corrections needed to improve the accuracy of LF Loran in the </p>
<p>north country. These data were extremely doubtful as all I really </p>
<p>knew was that the permanently frozen ground in the arctic would </p>
<p>greatly reduce the strengths of the ground waves, leaving the </p>
<p>effective time of arrival of the composite pulses uncertain. I did </p>
<p>the best I could, however, and prepared tables of the estimated </p>
<p>corrections for various latitudes and longitudes in the area to be </p>
<p>traversed by the MuskOx people. On the day before the expedition was </p>
<p>to leave Churchill I found an airplane that would take me there, </p>
<p>where I could try to find whoever was to operate the Loran receiver </p>
<p>that was being taken along.</p>
<p>At about sunset on St. Valentine's day I found myself, with about </p>
<p>twenty other strays, in the tail end of a DC3 full of wooden boxes, </p>
<p>starting the four-hour flight to Churchill. This was the only </p>
<p>aircraft I ever encountered in the arctic in which the heaters were </p>
<p>out of order. The passengers were sitting in various strained </p>
<p>attitudes on the boxes of freight with no opportunity to move </p>
<p>around. In spite of proper arctic clothing, I was colder than ever </p>
<p>before, and the other passengers were no better off. By the time we </p>
<p>reached Churchill, where the temperature when we landed was minus </p>
<p>fifty-four degrees Fahrenheit, it was not possible to move without </p>
<p>great effort and many of us were surprised that we were still semi </p>
<p>conscious. The pilot had obviously radioed ahead, as we found a </p>
<p>truck waiting to rush us to a messhall where plenty of hot coffee </p>
<p>was ready. There we found that we could not hold mugs of coffee, but </p>
<p>even this was provided for. One of the permanent residents sat with </p>
<p>each of the arriving passengers and poured the first two or three </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="muskcalf">The Musk-Calf Project</b> </a>200</p>
<p>mugsfull into him. At the end of a half hour my shivering was so far </p>
<p>reduced that I could handle my own coffee and even eat a little.</p>
<p>By eleven o'clock or so I was able to find the young officer who was </p>
<p>to operate the Loran receiver and I kept him out of bed long enough </p>
<p>to give him a very short explanation of the use of my correction </p>
<p>tables. To my surprise, I never heard any news about whether my set </p>
<p>of tables, or even the LF Loran system itself, was ever used. I </p>
<p>suspect that the receiver was probably abandoned as excess baggage </p>
<p>somewhere in the arctic.</p>
<p>The next morning was beautiful. I was up soon after five o'clock to </p>
<p>see the expedition start off, and was delighted by first view of the </p>
<p>arctic. I could see why some people fall in love with it. Every </p>
<p>thing was pure white, glittering as the sun rose, except for the </p>
<p>occasional top of a small fir tree. The infinite expanse of uniform </p>
<p>scenery had much of the fascination of a similar expanse of ocean.</p>
<p>I was told that only one press camera in Churchill worked that </p>
<p>morning. One photographer had had experience in such a temperature </p>
<p>and had, the night before, disassembled his camera and cleaned out </p>
<p>all lubricants. By operating the mechanism completely dry, he was </p>
<p>able to get pictures. It was certainly true that none of the many </p>
<p>accounts I read later was accompanied by pictures taken that cold </p>
<p>morning.</p>
<p>As soon as the expedition left in the direction of Baker Lake, I </p>
<p>hurried to the biggest hangar to try to find a plane to take me back </p>
<p>to Winnipeg. Fortunately I made friends with a pilot who assured me </p>
<p>that I could find room on his plane in an hour or two. I did not </p>
<p>realize until later that this was the plane that had brought the </p>
<p>Canadian Joint Chiefs of Staff and various other dignitaries who had </p>
<p>wished to see the expedition leave. I knew that there were a couple </p>
<p>of hundred reporters who were as anxious as I to leave </p>
<p>Churchill, and I was happy to have beaten them to the first aircraft </p>
<p>to go. Later I was even more pleased as, after our plane had flown </p>
<p>north to show us the caravan plodding forward and had turned toward </p>
<p>Winnipeg, a storm with a complete whiteout blew up and we flew along </p>
<p>at a very low altitude, with the ground barely visible and with the </p>
<p>aircraft lurching and rocking heavily as the gusts reached us. My </p>
<p>only comfort was the realization that the pilot flying all the top </p>
<p>brass of the Canadian military, with some guests from abroad, was </p>
<p>not going to let the plane crash if he could help it.</p>
<p>After catching a small plane to Gimli, I walked a mile or more to </p>
<p>the barracks. Having been warm in the aircraft and somewhat heated </p>
<p>by the walk, I ended by strolling along with my coats unbuttoned </p>
<p>and, I think, even with my mittens off. I happened to meet Angie </p>
<p>Pannosi near the barracks. He never thereafter allowed me to forget </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="thened">The End of LF Loran, for a While</b> </a>201</p>
<p>how I arrived practically in my shirt sleeves although the </p>
<p>temperature in Gimli was twenty-six degrees below zero. I never </p>
<p>encountered another situation when such a temperature seemed so </p>
<p>relatively warm.</p>
<p>The LF Loran work in southern Canada was carried out by an Air Force </p>
<p>research branch known as Watson Laboratories, but the technical </p>
<p>studies were delegated to a small consulting firm in Needham called </p>
<p>Pickard and Burns. This had been organized by Greenleaf W. Pickard, </p>
<p>who was a famous radio pioneer and at least one of the inventors of </p>
<p>radio direction finding at about the time when I was born, and </p>
<p>Harold Burns, a young business man. Their people, made some kind of </p>
<p>an error, of a nature I now forget, in interpreting the data from </p>
<p>the Musk-Calf project. It seemed necessary to me to write the Watson </p>
<p>Labs to straighten out the mistake. This had a most unexpected </p>
<p>result. Although Pickard and Burns were fairly appreciative of my </p>
<p>correction, the Air Force apparently felt very hurt by my </p>
<p>interference in their affairs, or perhaps by the way I reported the </p>
<p>error. In any case, there resulted a period of two or three years </p>
<p>in which Watson Labs declined to take any notice of my existence, </p>
<p>and I had no further contact with the LF Loran work until 1949. </p>
<p>This, at the very least, permitted me to clear my mind and settle </p>
<p>down to the different kind of work we were attempting to get </p>
<p>organized at Harvard. Probably the change was, as they say, as good </p>
<p>as a vacation. It certainly gave me the leisure to reconsider my </p>
<p>ideas about (in the words of the title of one of my last reports at </p>
<p>the Radiation Laboratory) The Future of Hyperbolic Navigation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the war professional societies were eager to publish </p>
<p>new material just released from military classification. One effort </p>
<p>to satisfy this demand led to my writing (among the other works that </p>
<p>occupied the latter part of 1945) a relatively detailed account of </p>
<p>Loran for the Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers. A </p>
<p>short form of this paper was given orally at the national convention </p>
<p>of the Institute in the spring of 1946. This was an exciting </p>
<p>occasion as it was, I believe, the first time a paper was read </p>
<p>before that Institute and simultaneously presented in England at a </p>
<p>meeting of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. This trick was </p>
<p>performed through the combined facilities of recording and radio. I </p>
<p>first read the paper onto phonograph records which were sent to </p>
<p>London and played at an evening meeting of the I.E.E. while I was </p>
<p>speaking the same words at an afternoon session of the I.R.E. in New </p>
<p>York. Things were timed well enough so that the readings ended </p>
<p>simultaneously, whereupon a transatlantic telephone circuit was </p>
<p>opened up so that the discussions of the paper could be heard </p>
<p>through loudspeakers in both halls.</p>
<p>The double presentation went very well, except that one part of the </p>
<p>discussion from England embarrassed me. One of the great British </p>
<p>radio pioneers, among whose papers is one that I have consistently </p>
<p>recommended to students as an outstanding example of a research </p>
<p>report, had unfortunately begun to lose his mental faculties. He-</p>
<p>chose to criticize my claims for hyperbolic navigation on the </p>
<p>grounds that the principles of relativity prevented a navigator from </p>
<p>knowing the time at the distant transmitting stations. He went so </p>
<p>far as to say that the errors of the system had to be as large as </p>
<p>the times of transmission from the stations; an obvious mistake as </p>
<p>the whole history of Loran proved that the relativistic errors were </p>
<p>thousands of times smaller than that magnitude. I had a few </p>
<p>extremely bad minutes while considering my answer to this charge, </p>
<p>knowing the great reputation of the man and also being sure that </p>
<p>many friends and acquaintances on both sides of the Atlantic were </p>
<p>listening for my response. I think I worked my way out of the </p>
<p>difficulty sufficiently well by suggesting that the relativistic </p>
<p>effects were limited to the square of the ratio of the speed of the </p>
<p>vehicle divided by the velocity of light. In other respects the </p>
<p>British discussions were not difficult to answer, although many of </p>
<p>them showed a tendency to belittle American achievements - a trend </p>
<p>that no longer surprised me. There was, curiously, almost no </p>
<p>discussion of the paper from the western side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>In May, 1946, I was visited by I. Bernard Cohen, later Professor of </p>
<p>the History of Science but then Instructor in Physics at Harvard. </p>
<p>Mr. Cohen was inquiring into the story of some letters exchanged </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Speech in Duplicate 203</p>
<p>before World War I between Lee de Forest and Professor G. W. Pierce, </p>
<p>later Rumford Professor of Physics and Director of Cruft Laboratory. </p>
<p>I had seen a reference or two to this correspondence in the </p>
<p>scientific literature, suggesting that it was the first attribution </p>
<p>of radio fading to a change from constructive to destructive </p>
<p>interference between a sky-wave and a ground-wave. Beyond this vague </p>
<p>information I could not help Mr. Cohen.</p>
<p>Professor Pierce had retired in 1940 and in his later years divided </p>
<p>his time between a summer home in New Hampshire and a winter home in </p>
<p>Florida with stops of a few weeks in Cambridge in spring and fall. </p>
<p>It happened that Mr. Cohen's visit came during one of these </p>
<p>Cambridge intervals, so I suggested that we go and ask about the </p>
<p>correspondence. We found G.W., as usual, receiving visitors in his </p>
<p>well-worn leather armchair while smoking his customary Upman cigar. </p>
<p>It was easy to induce him to look up the original letters.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1910, Dr. de Forest had been operating a wireless </p>
<p>circuit between Los Angeles and San Francisco at a wavelength of </p>
<p>about 3,000 meters. He was using arc transmitters that, had the </p>
<p>advantage of producing quite a pure tone but could, not be turned on </p>
<p>and off fast enough to respond to morse code. The telegrapher's key, </p>
<p>therefore, operated a relay that changed the frequency of the </p>
<p>emission, so that the dots and dashes appeared at one frequency </p>
<p>while the spaces between them were transmitted at a second frequency </p>
<p>far enough removed from the first so that the receiver selectivity </p>
<p>made the compensation wave inaudible. Dr. de Forest's operators had </p>
<p>observed that whenever the signal faded to inaudibility the </p>
<p>compensation wave was always strong. Being practical men, they </p>
<p>reversed the sense of the keying relay at such a time and continued </p>
<p>to transmit information at the secondary frequency until that, in </p>
<p>turn, faded away, when they would return to the original conditions. </p>
<p>It was a fortunate fact that, at that wavelength, fading was so slow </p>
<p>as to make these adjustments easily possible.</p>
<p>This characteristic behavior interested de Forest who wrote Pro </p>
<p>fessor Pierce about it, probably because G.W. had recently published </p>
<p>a well-known book, The Principles of Wireless Telegraphy, in which </p>
<p>he had suggested interference as a source of fading. G.W. eagerly </p>
<p>seized this chance to calculate the height of the ionized reflecting </p>
<p>layer in the atmosphere, whose existence had been postulated as soon </p>
<p>as Marconi had succeeded in receiving trans-Atlantic signals. By </p>
<p>1912, "G.W." had obtained all the needed information; principally </p>
<p>the distance and the amount of change in frequency. He then made the </p>
<p>somewhat optimistic assumption that when the layer height was such </p>
<p>that the sky and ground paths at one frequency differed in effective </p>
<p>length by exactly an integral number of wavelengths, the sky </p>
<p>wave/ground wave difference at the second frequency was exactly half </p>
<p>a wavelength greater or less. Upon this assumption it was easy to </p>
<b><p><a name="elayer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>G. W. Pierce and the Height of the E Layer</b> </a>204</p>
<p>calculate the apparent height of reflection, which he found to be </p>
<p>about 200 miles.</p>
<p>The correspondence came to a halt after the letter in which G.W. </p>
<p>reported this result. While it was not actually said, one may </p>
<p>reasonably infer that neither gentleman really believed that there </p>
<p>was enough atmosphere at such a height. This is not surprising, as </p>
<p>the large increase in temperature in the upper atmosphere was not </p>
<p>known in those days, and it was generally supposed that there was an </p>
<p>almost perfect vacuum above a height of forty miles or so.</p>
<p>To return to the day in 1946, "G.W." was sitting at his desk turning </p>
<p>the pages of the correspondence while Mr. Cohen and I read it over </p>
<p>his shoulders. After going through it once rather quickly, "G.W." </p>
<p>settled down to a more leisurely perusal. It happened that I then </p>
<p>moved to a position at the end of the desk. I was therefore able to </p>
<p>see that, as he read the letter reporting his calculations, a more </p>
<p>and more sour look was appearing on G.W.'s face. He presently picked </p>
<p>up the slide rule that always lay on his desk and began using it, </p>
<p>looking from the letter to the slide-rule again and again. At the </p>
<p>conclusion of his comparisons he turned toward me and said, "You </p>
<p>know, that answer should have been 62 miles". At this mention of </p>
<p>essentially the accepted height of the E layer, Cohen and I came </p>
<p>awake with a start. We carefully watched "G.W." backtrack through </p>
<p>the calculations and come to the conclusion that, in 1912, he had </p>
<p>taken the answer from the wrong end of the slide rule.</p>
<p>Professor Pierce was kind enough to inscribe and initial the </p>
<p>correction in the margin of his carbon copy of the erring letter and </p>
<p>give it to me as a souvenir, with permission to publish an account </p>
<p>of the happening "some time when de Forest and I are both dead". I </p>
<p>kept this copy as a favorite souvenir until after my retirement, </p>
<p>when I did publish nearly this same account of the incident in the </p>
<p>American Journal of Physics. At that time I thought it appropriate </p>
<p>to give the letter, with my description, to the Harvard Archives.</p>
<p>A result of this error was that the world waited a dozen years for </p>
<p>Professor Appleton to measure the height of the Kennelly-Heaviside </p>
<p>layer or E layer, as it was named by Appleton. His method was </p>
<p>essentially that of 1912, but with better scientific control of the </p>
<p>variables. It is an interesting footnote that both Appleton's paper </p>
<p>in 1924 and the paper by Breit and Tuve, that reported the first </p>
<p>pulse measurements of layer height in 1925, were both titled as </p>
<p>"proofs of the existence" of an ionized layer.</p>

<p>It was probably at about the end of the war that I received my </p>
<p>favorite memento of Professor Pierce. "G.W." was an amateur painter </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Souvenirs of "G.W." 205</p>
<p>of no great merit. In his later years, his office was decorated by a </p>
<p>dozen magnified pictures of some of the kinds of insects he studied </p>
<p>in his work on insect sounds. These paintings were dominated, and </p>
<p>probably preceded, by his locally-famous picture of The Dodo. This </p>
<p>was imitated from Tenniel's dodo in an illustration for Alice in </p>
<p>Wonderland, except that the bird was shown pointing a finger rather </p>
<p>than holding a ring. I have been told that G.W.'s painting was </p>
<p>inspired by a drawing made by Miss Ida Cannon, who was the head of </p>
<p>the Social Service Department of the Massachusetts General Hospital </p>
<p>and a daughter of the famous Doctor Walter B. Cannon, who was </p>
<p>perhaps G.W.'s closest friend. Whatever the origin of the idea, the </p>
<p>painting had much of its background filled by a quotation from Lewis </p>
<p>Carrol: "Why", said the Dodo, "The best way to explain it is to do </p>
<p>it". In his later years, G.W. spent most of his time in his office </p>
<p>sitting in his red leather armchair with The Dodo hanging above him. </p>
<p>He was always available to supply advice and sympathy in one's </p>
<p>research problems, and probably no student or staff member failed to </p>
<p>have at least one discussion that ended with G.W. giving his silent </p>
<p>advice by gesturing toward The Dodo with his cigar.</p>
<p>I suspect that there was no staff member who did not covet this </p>
<p>picture. My first move in this contest came in 1939 when Catherine </p>
<p>and I made our first Sunday afternoon call on Professor and Mrs. </p>
<p>Pierce, shortly after Catherine's arrival in Cambridge. G.W. </p>
<p>inquired what we would like for a wedding present and I promptly </p>
<p>piped up, "The Dodo, of course". He seemed to shudder a little, but </p>
<p>turned the conversation by saying, "Well, maybe some day", and </p>
<p>introducing a new subject. The Pierces quickly sent us another gift; </p>
<p>a luncheon set, I believe. I nevertheless took the maybe as </p>
<p>encouragement and thereafter at least once a year I brought up the </p>
<p>subject of The Dodo under similar circumstances. After five or six </p>
<p>years of this persistence, there finally came a Sunday when G.W. </p>
<p>said, "Oh, well, come to the office in the morning and you may have </p>
<p>it". Catherine insists that on that Monday I got to the laboratory </p>
<p>before the janitor. The painting still occupies an honored position </p>
<p>in our home. Years later, our daughter painted a copy of The Dodo </p>
<p>for me so that for my last decade at Harvard I could have a dodo in </p>
<p>my office as well as one at home.</p>
<p>The red leather chair ultimately followed the Dodo. After the death </p>
<p>of Professor Pierce, his office was inherited by Professor Harvey </p>
<p>Brooks. He presently passed it on to Professor Edward M. Purcell, </p>
<p>who later won the Nobel Prize. When he decided to redecorate, my </p>
<p>quarters were in Pierce Hall, but one of my spies kept my wishes in </p>
<p>mind and advised me that the time had come when I might get the </p>
<p>chair, which was by then in fairly decrepit condition with at least </p>
<p>two large holes worn through the covering. Ed released the chair </p>
<p>with apparent pleasure. I then visited Teddy Nahabedian, an </p>
<p>upholsterer in Arlington who had done many things for us, to say </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="newhouse">G.W. / Our New House </a></b>206</p>
<p>that I wished the chair recovered in top-grain cowhide. "I won't do </p>
<p>it", said Teddy, "No old chair is worth what that would cost". I </p>
<p>said little, but a day or two later had the chair delivered to the </p>
<p>Nahabedian shop. That evening Teddy called to say, "I've stripped it </p>
<p>down and it's a good strong chair. You may have your cowhide. </p>
<p>Naturally it cost a pretty penny, but we now have a beautiful and </p>
<p>sturdy chair to which I have a strong sentimental attachment.</p>
<p>Early in the fall of 1946, MIT inaugurated the first Arthur Dehon </p>
<p>Little Memorial Lecture, to honor the founder of the Arm of that </p>
<p>name, who was a generous alumnus of Tech. For this occasion, they </p>
<p>reached across the sea for the speaker and chose my old </p>
<p>acquaintance, Sir Edward Appleton, who had been knighted for his </p>
<p>ionospheric research and perhaps for his services as Secretary of </p>
<p>the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research during the war.</p>
<p>To get this lecture series off to a good start, MIT decided to dress </p>
<p>up the house. To this end, President Compton invited some five </p>
<p>hundred couples to a black tie buffet supper at the president's </p>
<p>house before the meeting. I do not know why this group included </p>
<p>Catherine and me, as surely there must have been enough more eminent </p>
<p>couples who owned evening dress in Cambridge. It may have been an </p>
<p>after-effect of my having been a Division Head at the Radiation </p>
<p>Laboratory.</p>
<p>Two things about this evening greatly amused me. The first was the </p>
<p>succession of scenes visible in the men's dressing room. It had </p>
<p>apparently occurred to very few guests to replace their evening </p>
<p>trousers after the war, and for many this was obviously the first </p>
<p>occasion when such costumes had been needed in a long time. I </p>
<p>hesitate to estimate the number of wives who had been called upon at </p>
<p>the last moment to insert gores in the backs of their husbands' </p>
<p>trousers. Many of those who had thought that they needed no such </p>
<p>assistance were unusually red of face and clearly found it difficult </p>
<p>to take a full breath.</p>
<p>When all hands had been washed and last minute adjustments made, we </p>
<p>assembled to run the gauntlet of the receiving line. I hoped on this </p>
<p>occasion to be able to discover whether President Compton could or </p>
<p>could not identify me. He had attended many meetings of the dozen or </p>
<p>fifteen members of the Rad Lab steering committee, but I was in </p>
<p>grave doubt that he knew me by name. I therefore somewhat </p>
<p>maliciously refrained from giving our name to his chief of protocol </p>
<p>and waited to see what would happen. Sir Edward foiled this plot. As </p>
<p>I approached President Compton, the guest of honor reached across in </p>
<p>front of his host to shake my hand and say, "Hello, Jack". My </p>
<p>opportunity was gone, forever as it turned out.</p>
<p>I am sorry to report that after all this effort on the part of MIT, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="MIT">A Party at MIT</b> </a>207</p>
<p>Sir Edward gave about the worst lecture I ever heard. It was the </p>
<p>only time I ever saw him appear to disadvantage in public.</p>
<p>The only other belted knight with whom I was ever on anything like </p>
<p>first-name terms was Sir Robert Watson-Watt, who carefully cultiva </p>
<p>ted the (British) title of the "father of radar". I have remarked </p>
<p>above in recounting my first visits to England in 1936, about my </p>
<p>doubts of the legitimacy of this epithet. During the war, Sir Robert </p>
<p>appeared from time to time at the Radiation Laboratory and once at </p>
<p>least joined a meeting of the steering committee. On that occasion </p>
<p>he was feeling unusually mellow and insisted that all of us should </p>
<p>address him as Bob. The only time I ever took advantage of this </p>
<p>permission was years later when my son Bob and I met Sir Robert in, </p>
<p>of all places, one of the corridors in the Boston Garden. I could </p>
<p>not resist trying to impress my boy by calling the distinguished </p>
<p>visitor "Bob" as I introduced my son to him.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>At the laboratory, 1946 was largely spent in planning the general </p>
<p>lines of our new research program and designing and building </p>
<p>equipment for it. Our first requirement was for a number of </p>
<p>oscilloscopes with cameras for making continuous records of </p>
<p>ionospheric reflection variations as a function of time. At that </p>
<p>date we could find no commercially produced oscilloscopes that were </p>
<p>satisfactory. We required unusually linear sweep circuits and </p>
<p>accurate arrangements for establishing the starting points of the </p>
<p>sweeps, neither of which was done particularly well in any scopes we </p>
<p>could buy. It was equally serious that we found no production scopes </p>
<p>that would stand up well. After a few weeks of 24-hour operation </p>
<p>each day, small components would fail at an alarming rate so the </p>
<p>devices were out of service, while being repaired, for a large </p>
<p>fraction of the time.</p>
<p>Jack Williams, to whose talents as an instrument maker I have </p>
<p>already testified, took over this problem and planned and built a </p>
<p>dozen or more very superior oscilloscopes. These weighed a </p>
<p>forbidding amount but were highly reliable. In fact they were all </p>
<p>still working well when I retired more than twenty-five years later, </p>
<p>having required only occasional replacement of parts (with the </p>
<p>exception of vacuum tubes) in the intervening decades.</p>
<p>We designed and built a special kind of camera to use with these </p>
<p>scopes. These were necessary because I had become addicted to a kind </p>
<p>of record initiated by Professor Mimno and used by him and by me </p>
<p>with a glow-lamp technique until 1941. These were made on long rolls </p>
<p>of 3-3/8 inch wide bromide paper rather than film, and the records </p>
<p>were made continuous in the time dimension by drawing the paper </p>
<p>slowly past the image of the oscilloscope sweep. This form of record </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="tooling">Tooling Up</b> </a>208</p>
<p>was advantageous because the photographic development was fast and </p>
<p>easy, while the records were large enough to be scaled, drawn upon, </p>
<p>or otherwise worked over without optical projection equipment. The </p>
<p>new cameras accomodated 250-foot rolls of paper and, except for the </p>
<p>lenses, were entirely made in our machine shop. These cameras, like </p>
<p>the new oscilloscopes, lasted indefinitely.</p>
<p>Our requirements for accurate timing were satisfied by the best </p>
<p>crystal oscillators available at the time, together with frequency-</p>
<p>dividing circuits and various modulating devices we made ourselves. </p>
<p>We were often lucky to be able to borrow good oscillators on </p>
<p>indefinite loan from the military services, and we made some in the </p>
<p>laboratory. Our efforts to improve these or replace them with more </p>
<p>stable oscillators continued for many years until such devices were </p>
<p>finally superseded by cesium-controlled or other kinds of atomic </p>
<p>frequency sources, also generally supplied as grants from interested </p>
<p>military laboratories.</p>
<p>Our needs for supporting equipment were amply satisfied by a friend </p>
<p>in the Air Force who had become the head of the Cambridge Field </p>
<p>Station, which had taken over much of the equipment of the Radiation </p>
<p>Laboratory, including essentially everything that the Division 11 </p>
<p>had left behind. Major Marchetti allowed me to walk through his </p>
<p>large Cambridge warehouse and choose what I pleased. He then sent to </p>
<p>Harvard several large trucks with about a quarter of a million </p>
<p>dollars worth of essential gear, even when assessed at 1946 second-</p>
<p>hand prices. This lot included a number of lathes and milling </p>
<p>machines, and quantities of electronic test equipment. This generous </p>
<p>gift, added to equipment and supplies left over from various war </p>
<p>time projects at Harvard, set us up in business very well.</p>
<p>It was our intention, at first, to apply improved techniques to </p>
<p>standard propagational problems at the usual radio frequencies. Our </p>
<p>wartime experience had taught us something that remained true for </p>
<p>many years: that there was a lack of the data and background theory </p>
<p>needed for the solution of practical communication problems. It is </p>
<p>usually assumed that scientists discover new principles and </p>
<p>engineers then use them to produce useful devices. In the case of </p>
<p>radio wave propagation, however, the demand for improved </p>
<p>communication systems has usually been so great that the engineers </p>
<p>have had to start with only their own best guesses and make tests </p>
<p>with actual operating devices to find out how well they would work. </p>
<p>We had learned that in the case of hyperbolic navigation the </p>
<p>"engineers" were far ahead of the "scientists" and that, in </p>
<p>principle, great efforts ought to be made to increase the pool of </p>
<p>scientific knowledge useful for the design of devices not yet </p>
<p>invented.</p>
<p>Harvard's was one of the first of many "three-service" contracts </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Org">Organization of the Work at Harvard</b> </a>209</p>
<p>between a university and the Army, the Navy, and (later) the Air </p>
<p>Force. Administration of this contract was delegated to what became </p>
<p>the Navy's Office of Research and Development, while the costs of </p>
<p>the basic contract were equally divided between the military </p>
<p>services. Guidance was in principle provided by a Technical Advisory </p>
<p>Committee consisting of research directors of various military </p>
<p>research offices and laboratories. It always seemed to me that this </p>
<p>guidance was quite nominal. The TAC members visited the Harvard </p>
<p>laboratories for a day once or twice a year and heard discussions of </p>
<p>the research in progress or proposed. The members could, of course, </p>
<p>show more interest in one program than another, but the chief duty </p>
<p>of the Committee seemed to be to tell Harvard how much money would </p>
<p>be available for the next year's extension. Harvard, in the person </p>
<p>of the Dean of the Division of Engineering and Applied Physics, </p>
<p>disbursed the funds granted under separate task orders to principal </p>
<p>investigators who prepared contract extension proposals carefully </p>
<p>tailored to require the exact amount of money that had been offered. </p>
<p>At least in my case, there never was any suggestion from either the </p>
<p>Dean or the Military about what I should be doing except that, in </p>
<p>the early days, one official in the Navy kept urging me to get into </p>
<p>low-frequency wave propagation before I could think of any practical </p>
<p>way to do so.</p>
<p>In the first years of the contract all research in wave propagation </p>
<p>was lumped into one task order under the direction of Professor </p>
<p>Mimno. This brought me back into the happy position where Harry did </p>
<p>the worrying about the budget, exactly as he had done before the war </p>
<p>except that there was now much more money. He continued one or two </p>
<p>projects of his own while most of the effort of the group was under </p>
<p>my day-to-day direction, assisted by Harry's usual intelligent </p>
<p>advice and political guidance. After some years, when we had worked </p>
<p>out ways of experimenting at the low frequencies, the military </p>
<p>rather insisted upon a separate task order for this work and I had </p>
<p>to learn how to devise and operate under somewhat fictitious budget </p>
<p>proposals. Until then, however, the radio work was all done in one </p>
<p>happy family in which there was no very evident allocation of duty. </p>
<p>Harry was, of course, responsible for the academic affairs of the </p>
<p>students who were working part time and studying for master's </p>
<p>degrees and doctorates, while I guided those research projects of </p>
<p>the group that were distinct from individual thesis research.</p>
<p>* * ** </p>
<p>A fulltime graduate student who did his research in our group was </p>
<p>Alan Waterman, Jr., the son of the man who had become the principal </p>
<p>scientist in the Office of Naval Research. This coincidence no doubt </p>
<p>caused us to be informally inspected more often than would normally </p>
<p>have been the case, but it probably did us no harm when the time </p>
<p>came for contract renewals. Alan found the right mathematical </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organization of the Work at Harvard 210</p>
<p>treatment for a problem that had been nagging at me. It had seemed </p>
<p>for some time that using pulses for navigational aid, which required </p>
<p>only a very slow rate of transmission of information, was a very </p>
<p>inefficient use of the radio spectrum. Alan and I were able to show </p>
<p>that, at least at the low radio frequencies, a continuous train of </p>
<p>waves with a low modulation frequency could probably have its time </p>
<p>of arrival measured with about as much precision as the long pulses </p>
<p>of Low Frequency Loran; and would occupy far less of the spectrum.</p>
<p>The most important idea was that the "relative information </p>
<p>bandwidth" for a time-measuring aid to navigation is proportional to </p>
<p>the speed of the vehicle divided by the velocity of light. Even at </p>
<p>aircraft speed, a low-frequency signal would need a bandwidth of </p>
<p>only a few hundredths of a cycle per second. We knew that the </p>
<p>receiver bandwidth for a useful pulsed system, such as LF Loran, </p>
<p>should be 20,000 cycles per second or more; a million times greater </p>
<p>than the theoretically-needed bandwidth. We could not, in 1946, </p>
<p>conceive how to build a receiver with no more than the theoretical </p>
<p>bandwidth for our proposed signal, but it was easy to show that one </p>
<p>could be built with an effective bandwidth of no more than about </p>
<p>five cycles per second. Such a receiver would pass several thousand </p>
<p>times less noise energy than would a receiver for Low Frequency </p>
<p>Loran. This would mean that we could either work with smaller </p>
<p>required transmitter power or use signals at greater distances, or </p>
<p>both. With these ideas in hand, and supported by what I knew or </p>
<p>could find out about low-frequency propagation and the ambient noise </p>
<p>levels, I proposed a new kind of aid to navigation which I named </p>
<p>Radux. This would operate with several stations sharing time at a </p>
<p>common frequency; each one would transmit a burst of signal lasting </p>
<p>a large fraction of a second. Slight differences in the lengths of </p>
<p>the bursts would identify each of the stations. The navigational </p>
<p>information in each signal would reside in a train of modulation at </p>
<p>200 Hertz, with coherence maintained from burst to burst. Such a </p>
<p>signal could be radiated from a practical, though large, antenna at </p>
<p>a frequency as low as 40 or 50 kHz. I calculated that, under normal </p>
<p>noise conditions, a few kilowatts of power should provide signals </p>
<p>useful up to a distance of 3,000 nautical miles, and estimated that </p>
<p>the average errors might be no more than three miles, or about the </p>
<p>same as the usual errors of celestial navigation on shipboard. </p>
<p>Because one cycle in a long train of sinusoids is indistinguishable </p>
<p>from another, Radux readings would be ambiguous in units of 2,500 </p>
<p>millionths of a second, or about 400 nautical miles or more in </p>
<p>position. It was to be expected that no navigator would ever be lost </p>
<p>by as much as 200 miles (especially with a continuously-running aid </p>
<p>to navigation), so this ambiguity was judged to be unimportant in an </p>
<p>operational sense.</p>
<p>These ideas were disclosed in a report that was published in 1947 in </p>
<p>classified form although, in principle, Harvard would not permit </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organization of the Work at Harvard 211</p>
<p>research to be done under conditions of military security. How I </p>
<p>managed this feat I do not really understand. One of the </p>
<p>inconveniences was that Professor Chaffee insisted upon sequestering </p>
<p>the manuscript and spare copies of the report in his own safe. The </p>
<p>difficulties in disseminating a classified idea from Harvard, </p>
<p>together with a wish to get on with our unrestricted research </p>
<p>program, resulted in my circulating the Radux report in military </p>
<p>circles and then paying no further attention to the idea for about </p>
<p>three years. At the end of that interval, the Navy had decided that </p>
<p>the idea should be tested and I came back into the navigation field, </p>
<p>as will be described later.</p>

<p>Just after World War II all ionospheric sounding, as distinct from </p>
<p>measurements of the strength of radio signals, was done at vertical </p>
<p>incidence. This means that signals, usually pulses, were sent upward </p>
<p>and the reflections from the ionized layers were received at a point </p>
<p>not far from the transmitter. This technique made it possible to </p>
<p>compare the times of emission of the signal and the reception of the </p>
<p>echoes and thus measure the effective height of the layers. The </p>
<p>effect on practical radio reception at a distance from the </p>
<p>transmitter (or at oblique incidence) were deduced from the </p>
<p>conditions measured overhead through theoretical considerations. We </p>
<p>thought that the conditions at actual reflection points were </p>
<p>presumably different from those over the transmitter or receiver, </p>
<p>and we had some doubts about the accuracy of the theoretical </p>
<p>deductions as it was not easy to account for effects due to the </p>
<p>curvature of the ionized layers, which are more or less concentric </p>
<p>with the earth. Such a calculation, we felt, was rather like trying </p>
<p>to compute the details of reflections from the distorting mirrors in </p>
<p>an amusement park.</p>
<p>Our techniques of fairly accurate timekeeping made it possible to </p>
<p>set up a series of actual experiments at long distances, which we </p>
<p>continued for several years. The backbone of these studies was a </p>
<p>path from North Carolina to Massachusetts. The transmitting site was </p>
<p>selected so that the center of the path to Cambridge was at the </p>
<p>ionospheric station then maintained by the National Bureau of </p>
<p>Standards near Washington. We could thus make direct comparisons </p>
<p>between what we observed at oblique incidence and the observations </p>
<p>of the Bureau made at the center of the path. These eventually </p>
<p>showed that our doubts about the accuracy of the theory were not too </p>
<p>well founded, as the random fluctuations at a reflection point were </p>
<p>usually nearly as large as the errors of the theory. It took us a </p>
<p>long time, however, to become fully convinced of this fact.</p>
<p>In the mean time, we extended the long baseline experiments with a </p>
<p>temporary transmitting station in New Mexico and some collaborative </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oblique Incidence Studies 212</p>
<p>experiments in which stable transmissions (that is, pulsed with </p>
<p>crystal-controlled timing) were made for us by experimenters in </p>
<p>Germany and at Slough in England. The pulse patterns received over </p>
<p>these long distances were remarkably complex. In the case of Lindau, </p>
<p>Hartz, at a distance of 6,000 kilometers, the experiments continued </p>
<p>for nearly a year before we could become fully confident that we had </p>
<p>even correctly identified the mode of propagation for each of the </p>
<p>several recorded pulses. Accurate prediction of the details of the </p>
<p>signals received at these trans-Atlantic distances proved to be </p>
<p>totally impossible, to our great disappointment.</p>
<p>Immediately after the war, Professor Mimno had managed to get </p>
<p>approval for the purchase of a permanent field station in Concord, </p>
<p>Massachusetts, to replace the borrowed locations we had used from </p>
<p>time to time before the war. This consisted of 130 acres of </p>
<p>abandoned pig-farm lying on the Concord-Acton town line, which he </p>
<p>bought for the modest price of $6,500, about a third of which </p>
<p>represented the surplus funds of the 1940 eclipse expedition. We </p>
<p>maintained this site for many year; setting up various experiments </p>
<p>in trailers left over from Harry's wartime work in radio direction </p>
<p>finding, or in decrepit buildings left over from the days of the </p>
<p>pigs. Unhappily, we were never able to promote funds for a permanent </p>
<p>building so all of our work there was done on a commuting basis. As </p>
<p>no one was in attendance at night, the installation was subject to a </p>
<p>great deal of vandalism and, over many years, we lost nearly </p>
<p>everything that was used or stored there. This problem gave us lots </p>
<p>of exercise in developing burglar alarms that were supposed to bring </p>
<p>the police in case anything was broken into, but most of the alarms </p>
<p>were false or else it took the police too long to get to our remote </p>
<p>site. So far as I know, no one was ever arrested. While this station </p>
<p>was active for automatic transmitting, Dave Davidson did some </p>
<p>excellent work in three dimensional recording of moving clouds of </p>
<p>ionization, using several receivers at distances of forty miles or </p>
<p>less in various parts of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>My reception of minor honors for the wartime work we had done began </p>
<p>in 1947. The new Institute of Navigation gave me its Thurlow award, </p>
<p>and the Institute of Radio Engineers made me a Fellow although I had </p>
<p>been a member only since 1945. These were followed in 1948 by the </p>
<p>receipt of a Presidential Certificate of Merit, which entitled me to </p>
<p>wear a little rosette in my buttonhole. Unfortunately, no one knows </p>
<p>what this represents, but I still wear it on rare occasions.</p>
<p>By the next year I was spending a fair amount of time on IRE </p>
<p>technical committees, defining terms and otherwise trying to bring </p>
<p>order into the studies of wave propagation and navigation. This led </p>
<p>to a few interesting months investigating the state of the country's </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Parmenter School Addition 213</p>
<p>studies for the federal Research and Development Board which needed </p>
<p>advice in the allocation of government research funds. In this </p>
<p>connection I was given a book of government transportation request </p>
<p>forms so that I could write my own tickets for any trips I felt I </p>
<p>needed to make. My official duties were to visit institutions </p>
<p>thought to be doing serious work in this field and to report on the </p>
<p>merits of their programs. It was never said, at least in writing, </p>
<p>that one of the desired ends of this study was to provide evidence </p>
<p>of the falsity of the idea, then strongly propounded by the Bureau </p>
<p>of Standards, that all worthwhile research of this kind was being </p>
<p>done at the Bureau's Central Radio Propagation Laboratory. After </p>
<p>visiting university and government institutions over much of the </p>
<p>country, I was able to demonstrate (I think) that not more than a </p>
<p>quarter or a third of the most promising research was being done at </p>
<p>the CRPL. This did not increase my popularity with the Bureau, but </p>
<p>it was work that needed to be done in the national interest.</p>
<p>As part of this work I made my first trip to California, primarily </p>
<p>to see the work at Stanford and at the Navy Electronics Laboratory </p>
<p>in San Diego, and had one of my finest small world experiences. For </p>
<p>some reason connected with scheduling, I flew to Los Angeles and </p>
<p>changed to a connecting flight to San Francisco. When I went out to </p>
<p>the Frisco plane I found an elderly woman who had been taken to the </p>
<p>steps to the plane in a wheelchair. I handed my briefcase to a young </p>
<p>woman who was with the elderly one and helped the latter up the </p>
<p>steps and into a seat. When I retrieved the briefcase the young </p>
<p>woman smiled sweetly and said, Thank you, Dr. Pierce. Because I was </p>
<p>a couple of thousand miles further west than I had been since I was </p>
<p>a baby, I was astonished. It turned out that the young woman was </p>
<p>a secretary (whom I had never noticed) at the IRE headquarters in </p>
<p>New York, who had seen me arrive for some of my many committee </p>
<p>meetings. This episode taught me that it was better never to rely </p>
<p>upon anonimity wherever I might be, a lesson that I believe to have </p>
<p>been useful.</p>

<font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="oscillators"></a></p>
<p>Our long-baseline work at the laboratory required more and more </p>
<p>effort to achieve precision in our crystal oscillators. We had come </p>
<p>to realize that these, poor as they were by today's standards, could </p>
<p>perform surprisingly well if they were completely protected from </p>
<p>changes in the ambient temperature and in the various supply </p>
<p>voltages. This meant several years of work in gradually learning how </p>
<p>to make better enclosures and in building power supplies that were </p>
<p>unusually constant. Jack Williams finally designed for us several </p>
<p>power supplies that had no less than four stages of voltage </p>
<p>regulation of various kinds. His attention to detail is shown by the </p>
<p>use of the average of several voltage-reference tubes (to guard </p>
<p>against occasional small sporadic fluctuations in individual ones) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Care of Oscillators 214</p>
<p>that were themselves enclosed in a special temperature-controlled </p>
<p>oven. We were quite sure that the 135-volt output from these </p>
<p>supplies never varied more than a few thousandths of a volt, even </p>
<p>over years of operation.</p>
<p>We attained excellent constancy of the ambient temperature for our </p>
<p>oscillators by enclosing the top and front of an old transformer </p>
<p>vault in the Cruft basement with a very well insulated wall and </p>
<p>roof, and allowing the temperature of the space to be established by </p>
<p>that of the earth several feet below ground level. This gave us a </p>
<p>small room whose temperature did actually vary about six degrees </p>
<p>between winter and summer (which did not matter to us) but which </p>
<p>fluctuated only a hundredth of a degree or so between day and night </p>
<p>or from day to day. As this room was small, the presence of a single </p>
<p>person in it would raise the temperature by a degree or two in a few </p>
<p>minutes, so we took every precaution not to enter it except in cases </p>
<p>of emergency. Necessary readings on meters were made from the </p>
<p>outside by a laboratory telescope and a system of mirrors. As far as </p>
<p>possible, any components that might fail and which could stand minor </p>
<p>temperature variations were kept outside of the enclosure. These </p>
<p>precautions, and others related to them, worked so well that it </p>
<p>proved hard, after we had begun to publish some of our surprising </p>
<p>results, to convince people that the frequency stability we reported </p>
<p>had really been attained with the kind of oscillators we used. This </p>
<p>led to a few years in which our results were often not received at </p>
<p>their actual value.</p>

<font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="endless"></a></p>
<p>Beginning in about 1948, our observations of signals at long </p>
<p>distances were supported by large volume of calculations. These, to </p>
<p>the extent that ionospheric constants could be assumed, were </p>
<p>intended to show how the time of propagation and the strength of a </p>
<p>received signal would vary with a number of variables such as </p>
<p>distance, radio frequency, and time. The majority of these </p>
<p>calculations were tedious, as they involved approximating one or </p>
<p>more ionospheric layers by 100 or more laminations of carefully </p>
<p>estimated density of ionization, and then tracing the path of a ray </p>
<p>leaving the earth at some chosen angle. The amount of refraction at </p>
<p>each interface and the time spent in traversing each lamination </p>
<p>could then be calculated, until ultimately the ray was found either </p>
<p>to penetrate the layer or be bent back so that it returned to earth </p>
<p>at a certain distance. Much the same calculation had to be repeated </p>
<p>again and again, with changes in the assumed angle of departure, of </p>
<p>frequency, or of the gradation of the ionospheric index of </p>
<p>refraction. I made most of these calculations, and they ultimately </p>
<p>filled a score or more of laboratory notebooks.</p>
<p>With many of the results of these computations in hand, it was easy </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Endless Calculations 215</p>
<p>to show that the number of rays reaching a given receiving point </p>
<p>was, in general, proportional to the distance from the transmitter, </p>
<p>even under circumstances such that much of the energy of the </p>
<p>transmitter would penetrate the ionosphere and be lost in space. It </p>
<p>was equally easy to show that in the absence of absorption (or </p>
<p>losses that change the signal energy into heat) the intensity of </p>
<p>each ray would be inversely proportional to the square of the </p>
<p>distance travelled. With more difficulty, it could be proven that </p>
<p>the same relationship was generally true even when absorption was </p>
<p>included in the calculations. The final result was the rule that the </p>
<p>strength of a signal was (among other things) proportional to the </p>
<p>angular distance subtended by the transmission path. This result was </p>
<p>not surprising, as it was equivalent to saying that the energy of </p>
<p>the signal (or of the fraction of it not penetrating the ionosphere) </p>
<p>was uniformly distributed in passing through an annular region </p>
<p>having a radius equal to the sine of the angular distance and a </p>
<p>breadth equal to the height of the reflecting layer. In more simple </p>
<p>words, I had proved the obvious; that for distances large compared </p>
<p>with the layer height the transmitted energy spread out in two </p>
<p>dimensions, being trapped between the earth and the layer.</p>
<p>This kind of proof was somewhat defective because it took no account </p>
<p>of characteristic phase interference that might cause signals to be </p>
<p>louder (say) near the surface of the earth and less loud near the </p>
<p>reflecting layer. My work was received with some interest but for </p>
<p>only a few years as several mathematicians were then developing the </p>
<p>mode theory of wave propagation, which accounted for just such </p>
<p>phenomena and soon made my discoveries obsolete.</p>
<p>The most fascinating thing, in retrospect, about this study is that </p>
<p>it was almost the first time there had been any strong evidence that </p>
<p>anyone had accepted the concept of the two-dimensional spreading of </p>
<p>energy in radio communication. Early experiments in 1905 and 1906, </p>
<p>made at a few miles' distance, had shown an intensity decreasing as </p>
<p>the square of the distance, just as the intensity of light does and </p>
<p>for the same reasons. Even before these experiments, however, an </p>
<p>editor of the English magazine The Electrician in 1904 had stated </p>
<p>clearly that at distances large compared with the layer height a </p>
<p>radio signal should decrease inversely with the first power of the </p>
<p>distance. The fact that it did so was, as we can see today, the </p>
<p>reason why Marconi had been able to receive a signal across the </p>
<p>Atlantic Ocean, to the amazement of scholars who knew (as Hertz had </p>
<p>proved in the 1880s at distances of a few feet) that wireless waves </p>
<p>were exactly long light waves and travelled in straight lines. Again </p>
<p>in 1919, an eminent English mathematician had sketched the correct </p>
<p>law for the propagation of low-frequency wireless signals, but there </p>
<p>is little evidence to suggest that anyone had understood him or, </p>
<p>perhaps, had been interested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="persistant">Persistent Errors</b> </a>216</p>
<p>In the mean time, beginning in 1909, the "classical" equations had </p>
<p>been written defining the intensity of radio signals as though they </p>
<p>always spread in three dimensions. These rules, with some </p>
<p>modifications in the absorption term and with (I am sure) the </p>
<p>accompaniment of many headaches, had been followed slavishly for </p>
<p>more than forty years. The headaches must have ensued from the </p>
<p>difficulty of fitting experimental data to an incorrect theory. I </p>
<p>took much pleasure, when my results were summarized in 1952, in </p>
<p>showing that, if this data-fitting were carried out honestly with </p>
<p>accurate experiments, the reconciliation would require in some cases </p>
<p>the assumption of negative losses in propagation. When the same data </p>
<p>were reexamined in the light of a correct theory, everything fell </p>
<p>easily into place and made excellent sense. But, as I have said, the </p>
<p>development of the mode theory made my work in this area obsolete </p>
<p>within a few years.</p>

<b><p><a name="alaskatrip">A Trip to Alaska</a></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1949 the long silence about Low Frequency Loran was broken. </p>
<p>Shortly after he had taken command of an Air Force development </p>
<p>laboratory in New Jersey, perhaps the former Watson Laboratory, I </p>
<p>found Colonel Haydon sitting beside my desk. He confirmed the news </p>
<p>that I had heard informally: that the three 625-foot lattice towers </p>
<p>originally ordered by the Radiation Laboratory had been erected in </p>
<p>Alaska, the Yukon and the Northwest Territories; and that the Air </p>
<p>Force had been flying with Loran around those areas and over the </p>
<p>Arotic Ocean, with very unsatisfactory results. The Colonel did not </p>
<p>find it hard to convince me that I should visit the stations in the </p>
<p>far north and try to learn why things were not working well. I was </p>
<p>especially glad to find that Dick Woodward, who had come to Harvard </p>
<p>from the Radiation Laboratory, and had now joined the firm of </p>
<p>Pickard and Burns (which still had a contract to advise the Air </p>
<p>Force in their Low Frequency Loran work) would be available to make </p>
<p>the trip with me.</p>
<p>It happened that my journey to the arctic began in July from our </p>
<p>summer home in New York State. It started with a flight from Albany </p>
<p>to Montreal. This short trip was broken into even shorter legs with </p>
<p>stops at Glens Falls and Burlington and, I think, one or more other </p>
<p>places. Because of the short legs, it was efficient to fly at very </p>
<p>low altitude. The result was the most beautiful flight I ever made. </p>
<p>We started an hour or more before sunset and flew along the Hudson </p>
<p>valley and the length of Lake Champlain, with the Adirondacks </p>
<p>stacked up above us on one side and the Green Mountains on the </p>
<p>other. We were so low that I could sometimes see fish jumping and, </p>
<p>on one occasion, a deer drinking.</p>
<p>I had a short stop in Winnipeg that allowed me a second visit to the </p>
<p>Hudson Bay Company's museum. The Company had, with the passage of </p>
<p>many years, become roughly the equivalent of Sears and Roebuck in </p>
<p>the United States, with tremendous stores selling mostly things of </p>
<p>popular quality. It had not, however, forgotten its beginnings in </p>
<p>the days of the voyageurs, and maintained at its headquarters in </p>
<p>Winnipeg a delightful small museum. It may have been there that I </p>
<p>first heard of the "canots de maitre" that had somehow escaped my </p>
<p>attention in a boyhood in Maine. These were huge canoes thirty feet </p>
<p>or more in length that were customarily paddled by fourteen men. </p>
<p>They were sufficiently capacious to carry several traders and two or </p>
<p>three tons of supplies or furs, and made the long trade routes </p>
<p>possible in the early days of Canada. I later found an excellent </p>
<p>description, by Harrison Gray Otis, of a factory full of these </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>218</p>
<p>canoes, and have occasionally seen a good picture of one of these </p>
<p>remarkable vehicles.</p>
<p>At Edmonton I met Dick and received from him and others details of </p>
<p>the sad story that I had heard in Cambridge. For some reason, </p>
<p>signals were simply not being received in the aircraft at distances </p>
<p>from the transmitters greater than about 400 miles. This seemed </p>
<p>absurd, because we had, in 1945, had reliable signals for at least </p>
<p>1,500 miles, and the low radio noise levels in the arctic ought to </p>
<p>have made even longer ranges possible. There seemed to be evidence </p>
<p>that the correct power was being transmitted and the receivers were </p>
<p>the same that we had used at lower latitudes, so suspicion was </p>
<p>directed to the aircraft antennas or to the coupling units that </p>
<p>connected the antennas to the receivers. The vague descriptions I </p>
<p>heard sounded as though these units had been redesigned by someone, </p>
<p>and I was immediately concerned as we had formerly used an effective </p>
<p>but unusual design that maintained the phase angle that the signal </p>
<p>had when coming from an electrically tiny antenna - tiny because no </p>
<p>structure on an aircraft could be as much as a hundredth of a </p>
<p>wavelength long. It was later determined that the coupling units had </p>
<p>been re-designed in an attempt to increase their efficiency. This </p>
<p>concept should not have been used because it involved altering the </p>
<p>phase angle by a large amount, with consequently heavy losses.</p>
<p>In any case, I found a chance, at the Air Force field laboratory in </p>
<p>Edmonton, to construct a rough equivalent of the old Radiation </p>
<p>Laboratory coupling unit, and took it along in my baggage as we flew </p>
<p>northward in an Air Force plane. The tales I had heard were soon </p>
<p>found to be true enough as the aircraft receiver we used had </p>
<p>detected no signals whatever before we reached Fairbanks. There I </p>
<p>installed the new coupling unit with the happy result that we heard </p>
<p>the proper signals on the ground at the Fairbanks airport and </p>
<p>thereafter throughout the trip.</p>
<p>From Fairbanks we flew to Point Barrow, a mildly nerveracking trip </p>
<p>for an occasional flier as the DC3 we were using was so heavily </p>
<p>loaded that it could not climb over the peaks of the Brooks Range, </p>
<p>while the passes were so full of clouds that we never saw the </p>
<p>mountains. The wide strip of tundra along the coast of the Arctic </p>
<p>Ocean seemed highly uninviting. For reasons I now forget we </p>
<p>travelled by water from Point Barrow to the site of the westernmost </p>
<p>Loran station at Skull Cliff. This trip took several hours in a </p>
<p>small landing craft in a long summer evening that is memorable as </p>
<p>the only occasion when I may have seen the midnight sun. The </p>
<p>uncertainty is one of definition because the sun did actually set </p>
<p>for thirty minutes or more, but did not disappear until five minutes </p>
<p>past midnight by my watch. Later calculations indicated that this </p>
<p>was an extremely sensitive condition. Twenty-four hours earlier the </p>
<p>sun would not have completely disappeared. The upper limb would also </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Antenna">Antenna Coupling Units</b> </a>219</p>
<p>have been visible had we been on the twenty or thirty-foot high </p>
<p>dunes that formed the coast line, instead of being at sea level in </p>
<p>the small boat.</p>
<p>At Skull Cliff we found everything in order with the transmitter </p>
<p>clearly working well. We had the last chance I ever accepted to </p>
<p>climb a six-hundred foot tower. Dick made it all the way, arousing </p>
<p>my envy, but about half way up I decided that the view could not </p>
<p>possibly be any better from the top. We found various odd pieces of </p>
<p>pipe sticking out of the ground in the region close to the tower </p>
<p>footings. These reminded me that I had heard seemingly silly rumors </p>
<p>about the Air Force having carried heavy refrigeration equipment to </p>
<p>the arctic to keep the permafrost from melting. This turned out to </p>
<p>have been exactly true, as the mush resulting when permafrost (or at </p>
<p>least the upper levels of it) is melted would not have safely </p>
<p>supported the tower. The point that had not occurred to me was that </p>
<p>the heat generated while the concrete footings were curing could </p>
<p>have melted the permafrost below and it might have taken a number of </p>
<p>years for the ground supporting the tower to refreeze solidly.</p>
<p>I found the balance between permafrost and the delicate vegetation </p>
<p>of the tundra to be very interesting. The ground in the neighborhood </p>
<p>of the Arctic Ocean was supposed to be frozen to a depth of two or </p>
<p>three thousand feet. In the summer the surface thawed, but only for </p>
<p>the top yard or less. The waterproof boundary at the top of the </p>
<p>permafrost allowed the surface water to collect so that the topsoil </p>
<p>was more nearly mud than earth. It was by no means as unstable as </p>
<p>quicksand and it did support a dense mattresslike vegetation a few </p>
<p>inches high. The surface, however, could be ruined very easily. We </p>
<p>were told that the tracks of all the caterpillar-treaded vehicles </p>
<p>that had ever traversed the tundra in the summer could still be </p>
<p>seen, and we did indeed see many of them from the air. The people </p>
<p>working near the Air Force stations had learned never to drive over </p>
<p>the unfrozen tundra twice in exactly the same path. Repeated use of </p>
<p>a path created a series of holes two or three feet deep that even </p>
<p>the tractors found it hard to escape from, as they were full of a </p>
<p>wet and soft mud much more slippery than the kind I had known in mud </p>
<p>season as a boy.</p>
<p>We went back to Point Barrow in a little Norseman aircraft operated </p>
<p>by a bush pilot who would fly anywhere and carry anything that would </p>
<p>earn him a few dollars. On the way down the coast we had seen from a </p>
<p>distance of a couple of hundred yards the memorial marker erected on </p>
<p>the dunes near the spot where Will Rogers and Wiley Post had been </p>
<p>killed in 1935. I told our pilot that I hoped I could get a </p>
<p>photograph of this as we flew north. He told me to go back into the </p>
<p>empty fuselage and open a window and he would do the rest. To my </p>
<p>surprise he took us down to a height of thirty feet or so and passed </p>
<p>the monument at a distance of twenty yards or a little more. The </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="permafrost">Permafrost / Homing Again</b> </a>220</p>
<p>pilot had waved to tell me when to be ready, but I was astonished </p>
<p>later to find that my snapshot showed the monument neatly centered </p>
<p>in the picture. Having brought us down to this low level with only, </p>
<p>as I recall, ten or fifteen more miles to go, our friend did not </p>
<p>bother to regain altitude. He flew along a hundred yards or less </p>
<p>from the coast and so low that he seemed to climb a little whenever </p>
<p>we passed over an Eskimo in a kayak.</p>
<p>At Point Barrow I enjoyed my finest shower bath at the naval </p>
<p>station. The bath house was extremely hot and the bath felt </p>
<p>wonderful after three or four days of working and sleeping in our </p>
<p>clothes.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>From Point Barrow we flew east along the coast toward the other </p>
<p>operating station, stopping for lunch at Barter Island, a small </p>
<p>Eskimo village near Prudhoe Bay, although at that date we did not </p>
<p>hear that name.</p>
<p>Our signals were excellent and readings apparently accurate. This </p>
<p>prompted me to make a suggestion, perhaps a foolish one. Our program </p>
<p>was to fly over the Loran station at Kittigazuit, a little to the </p>
<p>east of the MacKenzie River delta, and then fly up that river as far </p>
<p>as Norman Wells, this latter part being, as well as I can remember, </p>
<p>a trip that required two or three hours. Although we had only two </p>
<p>Loran stations operating, and therefore no navigational fix, I hoped </p>
<p>that I could so guide the plane that we would sooner or later pass </p>
<p>near our destination. This was exactly the experiment I had tried in </p>
<p>the blimp many years before, but now it would be done at much </p>
<p>greater distance from the stations and with mixed sky and ground </p>
<p>waves of far less predictability, considering my state of ignorance </p>
<p>about radio propagation in the arctic. Although the area had been </p>
<p>charted for ground waves, at least the signal from Skull Cliff would </p>
<p>be dominated by the sky wave component. There was, of course, no </p>
<p>experience in the arctic to suggest how great an adjustment should </p>
<p>be made for this factor. An additional source of difficulty was that </p>
<p>the course of the MacKenzie River was at such an angle to the Skull </p>
<p>Cliff-Kittigazuit baseline that the error of position was about a </p>
<p>mile for each two microseconds of measurement error, or about six </p>
<p>times worse than the nominal best. Any considered judgment would </p>
<p>suggest that I had no great probability of coming within twenty </p>
<p>miles of my target.</p>
<p>Everything, however, went very favorably. Not even inquiring what </p>
<p>the wind might be, and knowing only that our general direction would </p>
<p>be southeast, I told the pilot to follow a course of 135 degrees and </p>
<p>settled down to watch my pulses. Whatever wind there was seemed to </p>
<p>be compensated by the error in my assumed heading, and we flew along </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="wells">Homing to Norman Wells</b> </a>221</p>
<p>obviously near the right path. After a time I thought we were </p>
<p>drifting a little toward the east, so I asked for a course </p>
<p>correction of five degrees and held that for twenty minutes or more </p>
<p>before going back to the original heading. My difficulty was that I </p>
<p>had to guess at a sky-wave correction of perhaps forty microseconds </p>
<p>in the reading to be expected at Norman Wells. With no idea of the </p>
<p>exact correction, it seemed senseless to chase a number that might </p>
<p>or might not be right.</p>
<p>It happened that some sharp changes in the direction of the river </p>
<p>brought it under us twice at nearly right angles to our course. As </p>
<p>these crossings were half an hour or more apart I was able (simply </p>
<p>by glancing out of the window and at my watch) to give the pilot an </p>
<p>estimated time of arrival that turned out to be correct within a </p>
<p>minute, to my great credit, although of course this estimate had </p>
<p>nothing to do with Loran. After the one course adjustment I had made </p>
<p>we pounded along for an hour or more without my being able to decide </p>
<p>on another change.</p>
<p>The river at Norman Wells took a turn that broughtus there over a </p>
<p>range of hills near the town. The usual approach would have been to </p>
<p>turn aside and come along the valley to the airstrip. By the time we </p>
<p>got there, however, the pilot was interested in my experiment and </p>
<p>simply climbed a little to cross the range of hills. To my surprise </p>
<p>and delight we passed them to find the town a short distance away on </p>
<p>one side and the airstrip about equally near on the other. After </p>
<p>this experience I tried to be very careful about displaying my </p>
<p>navigational talents, as I was sure I could only reduce my average </p>
<p>accuracy.</p>
<p>This performance had a profound effect (for which I am very sorry) </p>
<p>upon Sid Colethorpe, the Air Force navigator of our plane. Poor Sid </p>
<p>had been fighting to make Loran work for a long time with no satis </p>
<p>faction whatever, and it obviously hurt him to have a rank amateur </p>
<p>do something he had been unable to do. He spent the rest of the trip </p>
<p>muttering things like, "You really can't send a Ph.D. with each one </p>
<p>of these things!" He seemed so depressed that I thought it kinder </p>
<p>not to tell him that I had no doctorate. From various sources I </p>
<p>learned later that Sid was one of the finest Arctic navigators, and </p>
<p>also that he continued to talk about this trip to Norman Wells as </p>
<p>long as he was assigned to the Loran project. He made it almost his </p>
<p>only subject of conversation when I met him at some convention years </p>
<p>later.</p>
<p>In spite of reasonably good success with improved antenna coupling </p>
<p>units, the Air Force lost interest in Low Frequency Loran after a </p>
<p>time, and the idea languished for nearly a decade until it was </p>
<p>revived under other auspices with the name Loran C. In this </p>
<p>implementation it had the benefit of greatly increased power in the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Homing to Norman Wells 222</p>
<p>transmitters and with a series of pulses from each station that also </p>
<p>helped to improve the effective signal strength and permit reliable </p>
<p>operation.</p>

<font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="appointment"></a></p>
<p>I have not explained how it happened that Dick Woodward had left </p>
<p>Harvard. After World War II the University had found it necessary to </p>
<p>formalize the up or out policy that had quietly obtained before the </p>
<p>war. As a result, the three of us from the Radiation Laboratory who </p>
<p>had corporation appointments were advised that our annual renewals </p>
<p>would no longer be given. We had plenty of notice of this action, or </p>
<p>lack of it, and Dick and Al Pote' presently found suitable positions </p>
<p>elsewhere.</p>
<p>In my own case, I found it hard to come to grips with the problem. I </p>
<p>felt that Harvard had given me great and undeserved opportunities, </p>
<p>and I hated the idea of leaving people who had become my dearest </p>
<p>friends. I did receive flattering offers of consideration, at least, </p>
<p>from Cornell and Johns Hopkins, and was sufficiently interested in </p>
<p>the former to visit the campus to investigate the faculty with which </p>
<p>I might become associated. A good friend at M.I.T., Jay Stratton, </p>
<p>had become President of that Institute and he expressed great </p>
<p>interest and confidence when he visited me - for unfortunately I was </p>
<p>the victim of a lingering illness during this period and spent </p>
<p>several months in bed. While Jay did not go so far as to suggest a </p>
<p>position at M.I.T., I think that he exerted some influence at </p>
<p>Harvard. Whether the reason was something of this sort, or simply </p>
<p>that Harvard had become used to seeing me around and perhaps had (in </p>
<p>spite of occasional indications to the contrary) a somewhat tender </p>
<p>spot in its corporate heart, the situation resolved itself before I </p>
<p>was required to make a decision. In June of 1950 I received from the </p>
<p>Secretary of the Corporation one of the comforting and coveted </p>
<p>announcements of an appointment without limit of time.</p>
<p>In October of that year, soon after the fall term had begun, I </p>
<p>received a request to call upon the Provost. This puzzled and </p>
<p>perhaps worried me as the Provost, Paul Buck, administered the </p>
<p>entire University while President Conant, so far as I could tell </p>
<p>from the little available evidence, devoted himself to such matters </p>
<p>as being High Commissioner to Germany or rarefied thinking about </p>
<p>educational policy.</p>
<p>I appeared in University Hall at the required time and soon found </p>
<p>myself engaged in an oral examination that, although conducted with </p>
<p>the greatest delicacy, was as comprehensive as any I ever heard a </p>
<p>doctoral candidate subjected to. The affair was, on the surface, a </p>
<p>friendly and wide-ranging conversation. I first recognized the game </p>
<p>when Mr. Buck was apparently afflicted by a slight and most </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Permanent Appointment and an Examination 223</p>
<p>uncharacter-istic mental block and allowed me to supply the name of </p>
<p>Frank Lloyd Wright during a discussion of Harvard architecture. A </p>
<p>few minutes later, after I had mentioned my interest in having seen, </p>
<p>in the Provost's outer office, the clock presented to the President </p>
<p>of Harvard by Simon Willard, I was allowed to show that I had been </p>
<p>able to understand the Latin inscription on the case. The </p>
<p>conversation roamed on like this for an hour and a half, touching </p>
<p>lightly (it seemed) on every field of learning except my own. After </p>
<p>this length of conversation I was beginning to wonder how my </p>
<p>inquisitor would manage to bring this pleasant chat to a close. Soon </p>
<p>the telephone rang, possibly by pre-arrangement, for the first time </p>
<p>since I had arrived. The Provost's end of the conversation indicated </p>
<p>that President Conant had a problem for him. Within twenty seconds </p>
<p>Mr. Buck was able to make his excuses to me and disappear in the </p>
<p>direction of Massachusetts Hall. He never spoke to me again. I can </p>
<p>only assume that he must have been overcome by curiosity about the </p>
<p>qualifications of this odd creature who had crept into his </p>
<p>university through the back door. This story reminds me that I </p>
<p>should tell about the only conversation I ever had with President </p>
<p>Conant. Soon after World War II I had become irritated by what </p>
<p>seemed to me baseless worries about the prostitution of learning </p>
<p>that might follow upon giving government grants or contracts to the </p>
<p>universities. To vent my feelings, I wrote a paper that I called The </p>
<p>Scientist's Dilemma. In this I maintained the position that the </p>
<p>ultimate responsibility lay, as it always had lain, with the </p>
<p>scientist himself. He could accept or reject any governmental </p>
<p>suggestion or request as freely as one from any other source. The </p>
<p>scientist had always shaped his research, to some degree, in a yay </p>
<p>that made it possible to attract money, whether it were from a </p>
<p>business firm, a learned society, or an interested individual. In </p>
<p>this respect, Federal money had no different effect than any other. </p>
<p>If the scientist chose to accept a grant, it would be because he </p>
<p>believed that it would do more good than rejecting it, whether for </p>
<p>himself or his college or his country or perhaps some other group. </p>
<p>He was, in any event, more fortunate than, many another, because his </p>
<p>university would not and could not force him to do research on a </p>
<p>distasteful subject. And so on and on.</p>
<p>It happened that this paper had justbeen finally typed so that I had </p>
<p>a carbon copy of it in my pocket when I went to La Flamme's barber-</p>
<p>shop for a haircut. During a wait, no less a dignitary than </p>
<p>President Conant came in and sat down on the bench beside me. The </p>
<p>sensation that this was meant seemed irresistible. Identifying </p>
<p>myself as I reached into my pocket with a hackneyed "I just happen </p>
<p>to have . . . " approach, I asked the President if he would be kind </p>
<p>enough to read my paper some time and let me know what he thought of </p>
<p>it. To my surprise, he started to read it immediately. After a few </p>
<p>minutes a barber called me. I thought momentarily of deferring to </p>
<p>Mr. Conant, but then decided not to interfere. From the far end of </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="haircut">President Conant's Haircut</b> </a>224</p>
<p>the shop I could watch in a mirror. Mr. Conant read carefully for a </p>
<p>total of perhaps twenty minutes, occasionally referring back to an </p>
<p>earlier page and some times apparently pausing to think. During this </p>
<p>interval a barber would sometimes call him, but he paid no attention </p>
<p>to these distractions. When he had finished, he looked around to </p>
<p>find me and brought back the paper. He spoke of it in a fairly </p>
<p>complimentary way, but declared himself disappointed that I had not </p>
<p>come out more strongly in favor of the idea of a National Science </p>
<p>Foundation, which was then pending. After five minutes of </p>
<p>conversation, during which the barber, Charlie Ferrara (who had just </p>
<p>come out of the Army) stood back and waited almost at attention, Mr. </p>
<p>Conant returned to the front of the shop, found his hat, and left. I </p>
<p>never dared try to find out whether he forgot his haircut or had </p>
<p>simply used up his available time. After this incident, for as long </p>
<p>as President Conant lived, the barbers would from time to time </p>
<p>inquire for news of my friend, Mr. Conant. It speaks well for the La </p>
<p>Flamme shop, to one who dislikes unnecessary change, that now in </p>
<p>1985 Charlie still cuts my hair using the same chair where he was </p>
<p>stationed in 1946.</p>

<b><p><a name="radaux">Radux and Other Things</a></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As described above, in 1947 I had proposed, in a report that had to </p>
<p>be classified, a somewhat different aid to navigation that I called </p>
<p>Radux. After three years or more of consideration, the Navy decided </p>
<p>that this idea should be tested. This raised a series of problems </p>
<p>for me that lasted a dozen years or more. Harvard would, quite </p>
<p>properly, not consider doing research under a military security </p>
<p>classification, while the Navy insisted for several more years that </p>
<p>the work on navigational aids for the future had to be classified. </p>
<p>This difference in attitudes, with the seemingly-obvious fact that I </p>
<p>ought to contribute to these ideas in the national interest, led to </p>
<p>some curious situations. My precise instructions from Harvard came </p>
<p>later to insist that if I should receive an envelope that I thought </p>
<p>might contain classified matter that could be related in any way to </p>
<p>any Harvard contract I must not open it but send it to a vice-</p>
<p>president of the University. At the same time, Harvard provided me </p>
<p>with a large safe in which to keep my classified documents, as it </p>
<p>was recognized that I had a legitimate responsibility as an advisor </p>
<p>to the government through membership on various committees or </p>
<p>through occasional formal or informal appointments to federal </p>
<p>laboratories and departments.</p>
<p>The Navy, also, had its difficulties, because security clearance was </p>
<p>only granted following a request from one's employer and Harvard </p>
<p>would not make such a request. This dilemma was eventually resolved </p>
<p>with a genius worthy of the proverbial Philadelphia lawyer. The </p>
<p>Secretary of the Navy designated John A. Pierce, with an address in </p>
<p>my office at Harvard (cited merely as Cruft Laboratory, Cambridge, </p>
<p>Massachusetts, without mention of the University), as a facility </p>
<p>which was entitled to deal with classified matters. I was highly </p>
<p>amused when the same mail that brought a certificate from the </p>
<p>Secretary testifying to this fact also brought a second document </p>
<p>notifying me (as a facility) that I (as a person) had been cleared </p>
<p>to handle the appropriate classified material, and warning me that I </p>
<p>must under no circumstances tell myself anything about the status of </p>
<p>my security classification.</p>
<p>To start helping to plan an experimental program for the Radux </p>
<p>system, I took my second trip to San Diego and began making the </p>
<p>acquaintance of a research and development group there, with which I </p>
<p>was to be closely associated for fifteen years or so. For most of </p>
<p>this period I made four or five trips to the West Coast each year, </p>
<p>for it was far easier to confer in person than to deal with the </p>
<p>various problems in writing, especially with the classification </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="RI">Radux Instrumentation</b> </a>226</p>
<p>difficulty hanging over my heed. The Navy Electronics Laboratory </p>
<p>agreed to build and operate transmitters at San Diego and Hawaii, </p>
<p>where reasonably adequate low frequency antennas were available and </p>
<p>not in continuous use. I began making a receiver and one or two of </p>
<p>different types were to be made under contract by the Sperry </p>
<p>Corporation, where Winslow Palmer (who had worked in cooperation </p>
<p>with M.I.T. during the war, and who designed the first direct </p>
<p>reading Loran receiver) could guide the development. Win, Dick </p>
<p>Woodward, and I, with representatives of N.E.L., the Naval Research </p>
<p>Laboratory, and the Bureau of Ships were formed into a steering </p>
<p>committee that really worked remarkably well, chiefly because it met </p>
<p>frequently and directly with the people doing much of the design and </p>
<p>experimentation.</p>
<p>In this 1950-1952 era, we at Harvard made rather cumbersome </p>
<p>receiver-indicators of a radically new design, because the merits of </p>
<p>cross-correlation (as opposed to simple filtering) were just </p>
<p>becoming recognized, while the elegant techniques that later came </p>
<p>into existence had not yet been devised. An almost miraculous </p>
<p>property of cross-correlation (or the art of comparing an incoming </p>
<p>signal with a noise-free replica of it produced in the receiver) is </p>
<p>that it does not have to be done extremely well to produce nearly </p>
<p>perfect results. This unexpected factor came to my aid, so that at </p>
<p>Cambridge my first crude machine detected and measured the relative </p>
<p>phase of a signal from Hawaii, although we never expected the </p>
<p>reliable range of the system to be more than 3,000 miles. The proof </p>
<p>of this feat was somewhat amusing. My first attempt to measure the </p>
<p>phase difference between the signals from Hawaii and San Diego </p>
<p>resulted in a reading about 2,500 microseconds away from the </p>
<p>expected value. After tracking the signals for several hours and </p>
<p>becoming convinced that the results were real and not a statistical </p>
<p>accident,I telephoned to San Diego to inquire whether an explanation </p>
<p>of this result could be traced to the transmitter synchronizing </p>
<p>method. After studying for several hours, N.E.L. called back to say </p>
<p>that the modulation signal had accidentally been inverted at the </p>
<p>slave station with a resulting error of one-half period, or </p>
<p>precisely 2,500 microseconds. Because I had detected this difficulty </p>
<p>in Cambridge before it had been discovered in San Diego, everyone </p>
<p>involved in the program had to admit that I had really received the </p>
<p>proper signals, unexpected as that might have been.</p>
<p>An early experiment on Radux resulted in my going to Hawaii to </p>
<p>support (or perhaps just to watch) some trials with a new receiver </p>
<p>made by the Naval Research Laboratory. These observations were made </p>
<p>at Wahiawa, a village surrounded by pineapple plantations near the </p>
<p>center of Oahu, where the Navy had a small installation whose nature </p>
<p>I do not recall. The experiments were neither very successful nor </p>
<p>failures and left no great impression on my memory, but the trip to </p>
<p>Hawaii had one or two interesting features. Getting there was the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Radux Instrumentation 227</p>
<p>first, as I had not before encountered the Stratocruiser that the </p>
<p>United Air Lines had begun using between the mainland and Hawaii. </p>
<p>This was, for its day, a tremendous aircraft that looked rather like </p>
<p>a doublebellied whale with wings. Seeing one on the runway it was </p>
<p>hard to believe that it could fly, as it seemed as tall as a two </p>
<p>story house and about equally airworthy. Actually, I was told, it </p>
<p>was a very satisfactory aircraft. It was the only airplane I ever </p>
<p>encountered that had a half-dozen berths, any one of which, for some </p>
<p>reason I never understood, could be engaged for a price of $10 </p>
<p>beyond the normal first-class fare. Even more surprising was the </p>
<p>fact that, just before boarding time, I was able to secure a berth. </p>
<p>As a result I was able to sleep serenely until a stewardess woke me </p>
<p>with morning coffee shortly before landing at Honolulu.</p>
<p>At Pearl Harbor I made duty calls on various officers who had only </p>
<p>the vaguest idea of why I should be wasting their time, and then was </p>
<p>driven to Wahiawa and installed in the Bachelor Officer's Quarters. </p>
<p>I found that the small group from N.R.L. had already set up its </p>
<p>equipment, so I really had little to do but watch the work proceed.</p>
<p>It happened that my stay extended through Aloha Week, a gala period </p>
<p>whose highlight was similar to the Rose Parade in California </p>
<p>although smaller. It also featured flower-decorated floats and was </p>
<p>extensive enough to last a couple of hours. For this occasion a </p>
<p>pretty WAVE lieutenant at Wahiawa agreed to drive me to Honolulu and </p>
<p>introduce me to the festivities. In honor of the time and place, she </p>
<p>dressed in semi-Hawaiian style. It is one of my happy memories to </p>
<p>have watched the Marine Corps guards at the station meticulously </p>
<p>saluting the good-looking babe in the muumuu as we drove out and in </p>
<p>again.</p>
<p>Of course I visited the Radux transmitting station at Haiku. This </p>
<p>was established in the remains of a volcanic crater, surrounded by a </p>
<p>horseshoe of mountains about 3,000 feet high except where the wall </p>
<p>had collapsed on the side toward the sea. The antennas were </p>
<p>stretched across the mile and a half width of the horseshoe, with </p>
<p>downleads from the centers of the various spans that dropped 1,500 </p>
<p>feet to the station on the floor of the crater. There was a large </p>
<p>antenna, consisting of four long spans, that had served for Navy </p>
<p>very low frequency communications, and a shorter span that had been </p>
<p>used for communications in the 100 kilohertz region. This TCG </p>
<p>antenna had been loaned to the Radux project for which it was </p>
<p>admirably suited. The whole site was the most beautiful place I saw </p>
<p>on Oahu, as the surrounding mountains were steep and green and </p>
<p>folded in complex patterns. The view out to the sea a mile or so </p>
<p>away included the only islands that decorate the coast of Oahu. The </p>
<p>only defect from a radio point of view was that the semitropical </p>
<p>climate and heavy rainfall encouraged a luxurious growth of vines </p>
<p>which climbed over the counterpoise network of wires that had to be </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="hawaii">A Trip to Hawaii</b> </a>228</p>
<p>used instead of a normal ground system. Chopping away this growth </p>
<p>required frequent and unusual maintenance efforts to keep the </p>
<p>efficiency of the antenna system at a reasonable level.</p>
<p>Among other entertainments, a friend took me to dinner at the </p>
<p>Outrigger Canoe Club, which I recall chiefly as containing the most </p>
<p>spectacular collection of beautiful women I have ever seen. I still </p>
<p>have no idea whether this display was normal to Oahu or whether </p>
<p>Aloha Week had brought in specimens from other climes.</p>
<p>A bit of shopping and a trip around the island completed my only </p>
<p>visit to Oahu. To my surprise, I was again able at the last minute </p>
<p>to secure a berth for my return to California. This round trip was </p>
<p>the only occasion on which I have been able to sleep in comfort on </p>
<p>an aircraft.</p>

<font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="noise"></a></p>
<p>In 1951 and 1952 I had a close view of some of the mechanism of </p>
<p>Harvard University. This experience reinforced my admiration of the </p>
<p>intellectual brilliance and, more importantly, of the sense of honor </p>
<p>and deep understanding of many of the University's officers of most </p>
<p>of them, I trust. It had happened that, in support of the Radux </p>
<p>program and for more general reasons, I felt the need of a survey of </p>
<p>the natural radio noise as a function of latitude. I borrowed a </p>
<p>number of noise-measuring calibrated receivers from the Navy and set </p>
<p>up a two-months' program, at the height of the noise season in </p>
<p>midsummer, so that all the receivers would be measuring at the same </p>
<p>frequencies on the same dates, with a schedule that covered the </p>
<p>needed frequencies again and again. The receivers were deployed at </p>
<p>sites along the backbone of North America, near 96 degrees west </p>
<p>longitude, ranging from Vera Cruz in southern Mexico to Resolute in </p>
<p>the Canadian islands in the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<p>Arrangements for operation at all of these sites were not completed </p>
<p>without difficulty, except inside the United States where we found </p>
<p>that the Navy had installations at the most improbably inland </p>
<p>locations. Even our good friends in Canada found enough reasons to </p>
<p>quibble to need two or three months of negotiations. Mexico we found </p>
<p>almost impossible to induce to cooperate even though we asked </p>
<p>nothing from them except permission to import and use the equipment. </p>
<p>In the end, all of Harvard's efforts failed except that it turned </p>
<p>out to be possible to get the Secretary of State, John Foster </p>
<p>Dulles, to exert his influence on the Mexican officials. The Navy </p>
<p>authorized several of its installations (that happened to have the </p>
<p>proper equipment) to cooperate with measurements made in the same </p>
<p>way on the same schedule, so that we finally had an excellent set of </p>
<p>measurements extending from the Panama Canal Zone to the State of </p>
<p>Washington and to eastern Canada, as well as from the pri </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>marystations mentioned above. I did not help with any of the </p>
<p>measurements myself but sat in the middle of the web answering </p>
<p>questions and trying to help clear up many problems with man-made </p>
<p>radio interference at the various sites. Happily Professor Mimno, </p>
<p>who was addicted to vacations in Mexico and had good command of the </p>
<p>Spanish language, offered to make the observations at Vera Cruz, </p>
<p>with some local help.</p>
<p>Before this project was ready, I had the foolish idea that it would </p>
<p>be advisable to do some classified work without having to leave </p>
<p>Harvard. This project was conceived as a support for the military </p>
<p>during the Korean conflict, which was agitating others besides me. I </p>
<p>started by writing a half-dozen page memorandum to my recent </p>
<p>acquaintance, the Provost. He did me the courtesy of taking the </p>
<p>matter seriously, although it would violate stated Harvard policy, </p>
<p>and presently called a meeting of about forty heads of scientific </p>
<p>departments and projects, to discuss it. I had exactly one friend in </p>
<p>this assembly and it should not have surprised me that the vote on </p>
<p>my proposal was rejected by a vote of forty to one. This result </p>
<p>really did not depress me greatly, as I could easily understand and </p>
<p>support the position of Harvard, and also because I realized that </p>
<p>the activity proposed would not be worldshaking.</p>
<p>The thing that fascinated me at the time, and, has seemed even more </p>
<p>improbable in retrospect, was that many of the same officials who </p>
<p>were strongly opposed to the idea of accepting secret work were </p>
<p>simultaneously doing all they possibly could to help me in the noise </p>
<p>survey. This appeared to me to be completely explained by their </p>
<p>acceptance of the fundamental idea that the holder of a permanent </p>
<p>appointment (minor though mine was) had to be recognized as the best </p>
<p>judge of what he should be doing. So long as my plans did not </p>
<p>"infringe" upon the work of others, the administrative officers </p>
<p>seemed to feel that their only duty was to support my efforts in any </p>
<p>possible way. On the other hand, when my plans threatened either </p>
<p>established policy or the privileges of others they would be fought </p>
<p>not with fury but with all strength and skill. It was, in this </p>
<p>example, inspiring to see how the dedicated officers could carry out </p>
<p>their dual functions without letting any emotional resonance to one </p>
<p>of them affect the performance of the other.</p>
<p>It remains unfortunate that the complete results of the noise survey </p>
<p>have not been published. There happened to be a naval officer in the </p>
<p>Bureau of Ships who insisted most vehemently that the data had to be </p>
<p>kept classified. This officer had essentially nothing to do with </p>
<p>either my research or the groups in the Navy and elsewhere that </p>
<p>needed the information, but he was powerful enough to intimidate me, </p>
<p>especially as I could not consider dragging Harvard into a </p>
<p>classification wrangle after it had been so helpful and courteous to </p>
<p>me. After many months during which several of us had worked hard to </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="American">Noise / American Academy </a>230</p>
<p>reduce the data to, or at least toward, final form for publication, </p>
<p>I gave up and stored the original and reduced data in the drawers of </p>
<p>a large desk. There they were essentially abandoned as the intensity </p>
<p>of the research that I soon began gave me no time to complete the </p>
<p>data reduction for many years. Fortunately I had been able to convey </p>
<p>the most necessary information to the groups that needed it by </p>
<p>letter or graph, and by personal conference.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>In 1952 I received one of my more satisfying recognitions when I was </p>
<p>elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. This </p>
<p>honorary society was founded largely through the efforts of John </p>
<p>Adams. For most of the two centuries since then it remained </p>
<p>primarily a local society satisfied with its Journal, monthly </p>
<p>meetings, and distribution of occasional awards. It has recently </p>
<p>become much more of a national organization. I take a foolish </p>
<p>satisfaction in the fact that the diploma attesting to my fellowship </p>
<p>was struck from the same engraver's plate as the one awarded to </p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin that used to hang on a wall in the house of the </p>
<p>Academy. I cannot refrain from quoting a few words from the charter </p>
<p>granted by the Great and General Court in 1780 where, after reciting </p>
<p>a number of good things that the new organization is entitled to do, </p>
<p>it concludes with the ringing exhortation: "and, in fine, to </p>
<p>cultivate every art and science which may tend to advance the </p>
<p>interest, honor, dignity and happiness of a free, independent and </p>
<p>virtuous people". Would that the current generation of Americans </p>
<p>(and especially the legislature of Massachusetts) felt as deep an </p>
<p>interest in these ends as did our forefathers.</p>
<p>Another award that gave me more than average satisfaction came in </p>
<p>1953 when the Institute of Radio Engineers gave me its Liebmann </p>
<p>Prize. This nominally marked the most important recent contribution </p>
<p>to radio. It was really given in response to my work on Radux </p>
<p>although that name was classified and could not be mentioned in the </p>
<p>citation. Soon after this award was given to me, its cash value was </p>
<p>increased. In 1953 the amount was enough to pay for the new dinner </p>
<p>jacket I had to buy so that I could attend the annual dinner at </p>
<p>which the award was given, with possibly enough left over to pay my </p>
<p>fare to New York for the presentation. This dinner was the last </p>
<p>occasion at which any lady said I was handsome, thus proving that </p>
<p>Brooks Brothers had done its duty. It baffles most people when I </p>
<p>tell them that this compliment came from the original Betty Crocker, </p>
<p>whose real name was Adelaide and who was married to an officer of </p>
<p>the Institute. The Liebmann Prize has increased in cash worth but </p>
<p>decreased in importance since 1953, because it is now only one of a </p>
<p>number of technical awards.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Radux work was carried on until at least 1958 but then subsided </p>
<p>in favor of a variant system that will presently be described. In </p>
<p>the interim there were many interesting happenings, few of them </p>
<p>truly technical. On one occasion when I spent a weekend in San </p>
<p>Diego, I joined Commander Lyle Read in a watercolor painting class </p>
<p>that was held in Torrey Pines Park. Lyle had done remarkable work in </p>
<p>getting the Naval air arm to accept Loran during the war and had </p>
<p>recently become Radux Program Officer at N.E.L. On this trip I </p>
<p>painted my only water color (that has been carefully kept from sight </p>
<p>ever since) and also caught a beautiful - if that is the right word </p>
<p>- horned toad that Catherine and I kept for a number of years. This </p>
<p>creature was named Radux Junior by the boys at N.E.L., and by </p>
<p>coincidence died at about the same time that the Radux project did.</p>
<p>After I had brought him to Arlington, we put him into an old </p>
<p>aquarium that had perhaps three quarters of an inch of sand in the </p>
<p>bottom. The next morning the lizard had disappeared, although a wire </p>
<p>cover over the, aquarium seemed not to have been moved. We hunted </p>
<p>the house over without finding him, but an hour or two later he was </p>
<p>discovered sitting peacefully on the sand. We deduced that he must </p>
<p>have dug into the sand although the surface had appeared </p>
<p>undisturbed. We then gave him more sand to make it easier for him to </p>
<p>go to bed. We also provided a light bulb overhead to simulate the </p>
<p>desert sun. It did not take long to find out that he usually dug </p>
<p>himself in about fifteen minutes after we turned the light out in </p>
<p>the evening. With patience we learned to recognize the body language </p>
<p>that indicated that he was about to disappear. He would rock from </p>
<p>side to side at an accelerating rate, finally lifting first one </p>
<p>front foot and then the other. After two or three minutes of this </p>
<p>preparation, he would suddenly dig madly with all four legs tossing </p>
<p>sand into the air. For a few seconds a cloud of flying sand would </p>
<p>have about the size and shape of the upper half of a horizontal </p>
<p>football. Then the lizard would suddenly stop digging and lie flat, </p>
<p>while the flying sand fell back and covered him. Instantly, it </p>
<p>seemed, both the creature and the flying sand had disappeared, </p>
<p>leaving the surface so smooth that it was impossible to tell which </p>
<p>part contained him. As he grew old, it seemed that he lost the </p>
<p>ability to keep quite enough sand in the air. Occasionally then the </p>
<p>final part of his disappearance was a sideways twitch that drew the </p>
<p>last half inch of tail under cover.</p>
<p>We also discovered that when we turned on his light the horned toad </p>
<p>would appear on the surface in ten minutes or so, presumably as soon </p>
<p>as the heat had penetrated into his bed. After thus learning his </p>
<p>habits we were usually able to make him perform for guests, because </p>
<p>it was easy to keep an unnoticed eye upon the aquarium and call the </p>
<p>attention of our friends just as he was ready.</p>

<p>A pastime indulged in from time to time by the Radux engineers was </p>
<p>an evening in Tijuana. I learned quickly that this city is really </p>
<p>neither Mexican nor American but has a kind of raucus charm </p>
<p>characteristic of the border. Two things were surprising: the low </p>
<p>prices of some things, such as a fairly good meal, and the small </p>
<p>number of people who spoke much English. A powerful drink of tequila </p>
<p>could be had in most of the many bars for fifteen cents, although it </p>
<p>cost twice as much in the places that called themselves night clubs </p>
<p>and featured raunchy entertainment. These saloons did not go so far </p>
<p>as to demand a cover charge, but they did not suffer from this </p>
<p>policy. I enjoyed learning to d rink tequila with the correct </p>
<p>formality, finding from painful experience that somehow the salt, </p>
<p>the tequila, and the lemon all had to be ingested nearly </p>
<p>simultaneously.</p>
<p>The chairman of the Radux Steering Committee was Charles Marshburn, </p>
<p>a North Carolina man who claimed that he had been raised to graze </p>
<p>his squirrels with a rifle bullet so that they were killed by </p>
<p>concussion without drawing blood. I gradually came near to believing </p>
<p>this claim, as Charlie could never pass a shooting gallery, either </p>
<p>in San Diego or Tijuana. It was particularly noticeable that the </p>
<p>greater the load of tequila he carried the more deadly his aim. </p>
<p>Charlie's favorite evening entertainment for a group of us in </p>
<p>Tijuana was to roam the streets until we identified the origin of </p>
<p>those old jungle drums that indicated that a strip-tease was in </p>
<p>progress. One of our favorite establishments, called in that era the </p>
<p>Stork Club, was used as a base by a bar girl and occasional </p>
<p>entertainer whom we called Belinda. This unfortunate child had lost </p>
<p>one eye but all her other components were conspicuously present. We </p>
<p>chose her name on the principle that she was as little like its </p>
<p>connotation as could be imagined.</p>
<p>One of my interests in Tijuana was based on the fact that few things </p>
<p>are as fascinating and educational as watching real professionals at </p>
<p>work. The saloons along Main Street (as the Avenida de la Revolucion </p>
<p>was always called) formed an excellent locale for this kind of </p>
<p>study. If, say, five of us entered a bar we would be joined by an </p>
<p>equal number of girls by the time we found ourselves ensconced at a </p>
<p>table little more than a yard in diameter. Within a minute five </p>
<p>tequilas and five glasses of similar appearing liquid would be on </p>
<p>the table, with a suitable apparatus of salt shakers and lemon </p>
<p>fragments. The bill, collected at once, would be three dollars. At </p>
<p>intervals of three to five minutes, a waiter would present himself </p>
<p>to take orders for refills. After two or three of these it could be </p>
<p>noticed, by one who paid attention to the mechanics of the </p>
<p>operation, that some girl would order another round if the customers </p>
<p>did not do so promptly enough. After half an hour some of the </p>
<p>Americans might find it discreet to pass when refills were ordered, </p>
<p>but this would make no difference in the price which would remain at </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="tijuana">Tijuana</b> </a>233</p>
<p>three dollars. Eventually a careful observer could note that even </p>
<p>when the only refreshments were glasses of colored water for the </p>
<p>girls, the cost per round remained at the level that had been </p>
<p>established at the beginning of the visit.</p>
<p>Another pleasant opportunity to watch the Tijuanans share their </p>
<p>fortune came one evening when Win Palmer talked the group into going </p>
<p>to Mexico so that he could shop for a half-sized guitar. Win sailed </p>
<p>a small boat and was bothered because his normal guitar took up too </p>
<p>much room. Inquiry at the first of a hundred or more possible shops </p>
<p>did not produce an instrument of the desired size and quality. The </p>
<p>word that a sucker was in town, however, spread faster than we could </p>
<p>walk. For the rest of the evening, no matter where we wandered, two </p>
<p>or three times in each block we would find a salesman with a small </p>
<p>guitar and an importunate manner on the sidewalk in front of his </p>
<p>shop.</p>
<p>On one occasion I thought for a short time that I was gaining some </p>
<p>ability as a trader. In one of the tourist traps I found a pretty </p>
<p>leather handbag that I thought Catherine might like. Earlier </p>
<p>observations had taught me that such a bag would cost fifty dollars </p>
<p>or more in Boston, so I was not surprised to find that the asking </p>
<p>price was $27.95, in American money of course. Having little else to </p>
<p>amuse me at the moment, I offered five dollars, and spent the next </p>
<p>half hour in offers and counterproposals, interspersed with </p>
<p>occasional feints at leaving.</p>
<p>In the end I bought the bag for eight dollars and left the shop </p>
<p>feeling greatly pleased with myself. Nothing would have been easier </p>
<p>than to forget the bag at the customs office, but I thought it might </p>
<p>be well to pay the duty and get the bag stamped in case Catherine </p>
<p>ever happened to cross a border with it. To my chagrin, the customs </p>
<p>officer glanced at the bag and charged me the duty on a value of </p>
<p>$6.50. At least I got the bag stamped and Catherine liked it, but my </p>
<p>opinion of my trading ability instantly went back to its former </p>
<p>level.</p>

<p>Having told of my very good luck in the flight up the Mackenzie </p>
<p>River, I should expose the other side of my small career as a </p>
<p>navigator. This episode came near the end of the Radux program, </p>
<p>before that effort evolved into the more interesting and fruitful </p>
<p>work at the very low radio frequencies. Radux had developed and been </p>
<p>tested to the point at which the Navy wanted independent trials of </p>
<p>the system. These were to be conducted by operating forces and were </p>
<p>not even to be observed by those who had developed the system. At </p>
<p>this date there were three transmitters, at Hawaii, San Diego, and </p>
<p>near Seattle, so that good crossings were available between the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very Bad Navigation 234</p>
<p>lines from a rather long pair across the eastern Pacific and those </p>
<p>from a somewhat short pair along the coast. One of the proposed </p>
<p>exercises was to take advantage of the fact that the Radux signals </p>
<p>could be measured a few feet below the surface of the ocean. It was </p>
<p>planned that an aircraft and a submarine, both navigated by Radux, </p>
<p>should rendezvous off the California coast, when the plane was </p>
<p>supposed to fly over the submarine just as the latter came to the </p>
<p>surface.</p>
<p>I happened to be in San Diego shortly before these trials were to </p>
<p>begin, and had the opportunity to direct an aircraft in a make-</p>
<p>believe meeting with a fictitious submarine at a given time. I </p>
<p>decided that the most elegant way to do this was to fly out to sea </p>
<p>along a Radux line of position that would cross the line of the </p>
<p>other pair of stations which passed through the meeting point, and </p>
<p>then to follow that second line to arrive at the correct point at </p>
<p>the agreed time. It happened that we flew west crossing a strong </p>
<p>south wind, but I had plenty of time to measure the wind speed and </p>
<p>calculate how long it would take to go from our turning point to the </p>
<p>rendezvous. Having started in good time, I found that we reached the </p>
<p>place where we should turn south with ten minutes to spare. I then </p>
<p>thoughtlessly ordered the pilot to circle for a few minutes to use </p>
<p>up our surplus time and then relaxed, which I should never have </p>
<p>done. When I returned to paying attention to our position, I found </p>
<p>that the wind had carried us so far north during the circling that </p>
<p>we could not fly fast enough to reach the rendezvous point in time. </p>
<p>When we duly arrived at the right place three or four minutes late, </p>
<p>I was promptly and none too courteously advised that I should have </p>
<p>asked the pilot to drop a smoke flare so that we could circle a </p>
<p>fixed point. This suggestion was so simple and immediately obvious </p>
<p>that I stil feel the flush of shame as I write about it.</p>
<p>I assume, without proof, that the professionals who carried out the </p>
<p>official trials made no such foolish errors. At least their </p>
<p>conclusions were moderately complimentary. The truth was, however, </p>
<p>that no one really wanted an aid to navigation that was less </p>
<p>accurate than Loran, even if it did have greater range. This simple </p>
<p>fact had much to do with the success of later developments.</p>

<p>19.</p>
<b><p>Very Low Frequencies </p>
</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1953 a happy circumstance began to turn my attention toward the </p>
<p>low and very low radio frequencies. This spectral region had seemed </p>
<p>a nevernever land for an aid to navigation because, at these </p>
<p>frequencies, it is not possible to radiate a short pulse or even a </p>
<p>tone of ordinary audible frequency without an antenna a large </p>
<p>fraction of a mile high and an extent of at least several miles. It </p>
<p>turned out that I was seriously undervaluing the measurement of the </p>
<p>phase of a steady radio-frequency signal, even though I had become </p>
<p>familiar with this idea in the work on Low Frequency Loran nearly a </p>
<p>decade earlier.</p>
<p>The fortunate event was a visit of Dr. Louis Essen to Harvard to </p>
<p>give a Physics Colloquium, very probably about his recent work in </p>
<p>measuring the velocity of light. Dr. Essen was a Principal </p>
<p>Scientific Officer at the National Physical Laboratory in England. </p>
<p>At the time I am sure I did not know of all three of his recent </p>
<p>successes, any one of which would have established a first-class </p>
<p>reputation. He had controlled the size and shape of a quartz cavity, </p>
<p>a few inches in dimensions, so accurately that in that small space </p>
<p>he made what was at the time the most accurate measurement of the </p>
<p>velocity of light. He had also made what remained for years the </p>
<p>world's most constant crystal clock, using a large and very </p>
<p>accurately machined toroid of quartz (the Essen Ring). And he was at </p>
<p>the time developing the first clock controlled by an atomic </p>
<p>resonance in cesium; a technique that has now reached a remarkably </p>
<p>advanced stage with clocks that approach a precision of a millionth </p>
<p>of a second per year.</p>
<p>After his lecture, Dr. Essen came to see our work in the long-</p>
<p>distance measurement of propagational factors, which depended upon </p>
<p>reasonably good frequency control at both ends of the radio circuit. </p>
<p>He promptly saw that this technique might easily be applied to the </p>
<p>measurement of a standard-frequency transmission that had been begun </p>
<p>from the great Post Office radio station at Rugby, England. As a </p>
<p>tool for research and commercial calibration within the British </p>
<p>Isles, the frequency of a small transmitter at 60 kilohertz had been </p>
<p>derived from an Essen Ring oscillator. This frequency was monitored </p>
<p>and corrected through observation at the National Physical </p>
<p>Laboratory as well as at the Greenwich Observatory and at the Post </p>
<p>Office headquarters in London. This signal was transmitted for only </p>
<p>an hour each day and at rather low power, but Dr. Essen thought our </p>
<p>techniques might be sensitive enough to permit good measurement of </p>
<p>the frequency at Harvard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost as soon as Dr. Essen left us, we began the construction of a </p>
<p>special receiver for this 60 kHz signal. This became the first of a </p>
<p>long line of receivers for phase-stable transmissions. We gradually </p>
<p>perfected our technique for limiting the output level of a signal, </p>
<p>rather than using automatic gain control, and we learned to separate </p>
<p>the two functions of amplification and establishment of frequency </p>
<p>selectivity, so that the output phase became independent of the </p>
<p>strength of the signal or of the noise interference. Even this first </p>
<p>carrier-frequency receiver, however, performed what seemed to us to </p>
<p>be a miracle, considering the weakness of the input signal. The new </p>
<p>instrument produced an output so free of contamination that its </p>
<p>phase could be measured with a standard deviation of no more than </p>
<p>four or five degrees of arc, or a quarter of a microsecond in the </p>
<p>apparent time of arrival.</p>
<p>These observations opened a surprising set of possibilities. The </p>
<p>most immediately important was that during the one-hour transmission </p>
<p>of the MSF signal (as it was identified by its call letters, the SF </p>
<p>representing standard frequency) we could measure its frequency to </p>
<p>one part in ten billion, or to the equivalent of about ten </p>
<p>millionths of a second per day in the rate of our clock with respect </p>
<p>to Rugby.</p>
<p>To appreciate the importance of this observation, it is necessary to </p>
<p>review the possibilities that existed in 1953 for long-distance </p>
<p>intercomparisons of clocks. The standard of time was then, as it had </p>
<p>been throughout recorded history, the rotation of the earth. This </p>
<p>standard is not as constant as one might wish, because the rate is </p>
<p>slowed gradually by tidal friction and other factors, and because </p>
<p>the rotation is made irregular by the varied push or drag exerted by </p>
<p>the action of the winds and the currents in the ocean, and in all </p>
<p>probability by similar currents in the molten interior of the earth. </p>
<p>There is also an annual variation caused by the accumulation of snow </p>
<p>on the mountains in the northern winter, which slows the rotation </p>
<p>until melting returns some weight toward sea level in the </p>
<p>springtime. The total of these effects, and doubtless others, is to </p>
<p>make the time as established by the earth vary through a tenth of a </p>
<p>second or so during the year. There are also occasional sporadic </p>
<p>variations, possibly related to earthquakes, that help to make the </p>
<p>prediction of the rate of rotation of the earth difficult and </p>
<p>inaccurate.</p>
<p>Another limitation arises from the fact that time, defined in this </p>
<p>way, must ultimately be measured by the passage of stars across the </p>
<p>meridian and this, because of the slowness of the passage and of </p>
<p>ordinary errors of observation, cannot be determined with an error </p>
<p>less than about five milliseconds. At this level of error, the rate </p>
<p>of rotation of the earth can only be measured to about one part in </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="sixty">60-Kilohertz Frequency Comparisons</a></b> 237</p>
<p>ten million from one day (or night) to the next. It is also </p>
<p>unfortunate that the sending of time signals from one part of the </p>
<p>world to another was, before the age of satellites, subject to </p>
<p>errors of at least the same magnitude. For transmission at low </p>
<p>frequencies, as said above, one cannot produce a short pulse that </p>
<p>could be measured with precision. The same limitation applies for </p>
<p>transmission by telephone or telegraph wire, except in the case of </p>
<p>the coaxial cable which is not yet available except between a </p>
<p>limited number of terminals. For high frequency propagation, except </p>
<p>at very short distances, irregularities are caused by fluctuations </p>
<p>in the height of the ionized layers that reflect the signals. In </p>
<p>short, errors in frequency measurement (which is not the same as </p>
<p>time measurement but is at least closely related to it) were not </p>
<p>often, at long distances, smaller than a few parts in one hundred </p>
<p>million. Thus, surprisingly, we found ourselves with an apparently </p>
<p>reliable radio method of intercomparing frequencies from distant </p>
<p>places with an accuracy between a hundred and a thousand times that </p>
<p>which was known before.</p>
<p>It was immediately obvious that there would be a great increase in </p>
<p>the average accuracy of frequency measurement if the signal from NSF </p>
<p>could be tracked continuously from one day to the next. It is an </p>
<p>inconvenient fact that the phase of a simple sinusoidal signal is </p>
<p>highly ambiguous, as has been noted earlier. With a signal at 60 </p>
<p>kHz, these ambiguities were separated by only 16-2/3 microseconds, </p>
<p>while the apparent precision of a part in ten billion corresponded </p>
<p>to a probable drift of more than half that amount in a period of </p>
<p>twenty-four hours. Thus the straight line in frequency, determined </p>
<p>in one hour, could be projected forward to the succeeding day with a </p>
<p>chance, but no certainty, of identifying the correct cycle on the </p>
<p>second day. The reliability of such an estimate would depend almost </p>
<p>entirely upon the question of whether the oscillators (or clocks) at </p>
<p>both ends of the radio circuit could be relied upon to maintain </p>
<p>constant rates during the many hours when they were not being </p>
<p>compared. With the limited knowledge of precision oscillators </p>
<p>available in 1953, a long silent period seemed to make the </p>
<p>measurement too uncertain to be worth considering.</p>
<p>My first step toward better day-to-day precision was, of course, to </p>
<p>communicate with Dr. Essen and presently with Mr. H. T. Mitchell, </p>
<p>the Post Office executive most concerned with control of frequency, </p>
<p>to see whether the NSF transmissions could be extended in time. It </p>
<p>was ultimately possible to get occasional 24-hour transmissions, but </p>
<p>so rarely. were they available that determination of the reliability </p>
<p>of a continuous measurement was not attainable.</p>
<p>When I was sure that this effort was not becoming very productive, I </p>
<p>began a more serious campaign. Rugby was famous (aside from </p>
<p>football) not for the weak MSF transmission but for the 16 kHz </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="problems">Problems in Intercomparison of Time</b> </a>238</p>
<p>signal whose call letters were GBR. This transmitter was maintained </p>
<p>and operated by the Post Office but used to a great extent for Naval </p>
<p>communications on a nearly worldwide basis. The power radiated was </p>
<p>many times greater than that used by MSF, and the frequency was </p>
<p>better adapted to long-range communication. This station, </p>
<p>incidentally, was so well known that it was one of the few places I </p>
<p>had visited during my first stop in England in 1936.</p>
<p>My first attempts to induce the Post Office to derive the frequency </p>
<p>of GBR from the same source used for MSF met with no success. It did </p>
<p>not appear to be difficult to provide the necessary equipment for </p>
<p>this change, but the Post Office realized quite clearly that, for </p>
<p>their limited purpose of supplying a standard frequency useful in </p>
<p>the British Isles, the MSF signal was better than that of GBR would </p>
<p>be, because for a given accuracy the higher frequency could allow </p>
<p>faster measurements.</p>
<p>When these attempts showed no indication that they would ever be </p>
<p>successful, I attacked the problem through Mr. J. A. Ratcliffe, whom </p>
<p>I had met as far back as my 1936 visit and who had become the </p>
<p>director of the Radio Research Board's experimental station at </p>
<p>Slough. My chief argument was that there was to be a total eclipse </p>
<p>of the sun in 1954 whose track would cross the path of the signal </p>
<p>from England to New England. I made the suggestion, with or without </p>
<p>serious belief, that the behavior of the phase of the GBR signal at </p>
<p>such a low frequency might cast new light upon the structure of the </p>
<p>ionosphere. To my complete surprise and pleasure, Mr. Ratcliffe's </p>
<p>resulting pressure on the Post Office was completely successful, as </p>
<p>the necessary frequency-synthesizing equipment was soon prepared and </p>
<p>installed. I am sorry to have to admit that the eclipse effect, </p>
<p>although I duly observed it, was so minor that it proved nothing in </p>
<p>particular. The GBR frequency-deriving equipment, however, since it </p>
<p>had been officially made and installed by the Post Office, remained </p>
<p>in existence and provided a very useful service until the present </p>
<p>day, I believe, or certainly at least until my retirement.</p>
<p>At this lower frequency and with transmission that was continuous </p>
<p>except for an hour or two each day, there was no longer a question </p>
<p>of cycle-slipping or ambiguity. It quickly became clear that, </p>
<p>although there was a change of more than 30 microseconds in the time </p>
<p>taken by the propagation between day and night, at any chosen hour </p>
<p>of the day the phase of the received signal repeated from day to day </p>
<p>with excellent accuracy. This was the first of many observations </p>
<p>that showed a propagational stability greater than that usually </p>
<p>attained by our oscillators. This aspect of the newly-discovered </p>
<p>precision of frequency measurement made many people doubtful that I </p>
<p>could be attaining the results I claimed. As I have suggested above, </p>
<p>extremely careful control of the temperature of our oscillators and </p>
<p>of the voltages applied to them were an important part of the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="VLF">The First VLF Phase Measurements</b> </a>239</p>
<p>program. Another was the fact that I was not required to judge the </p>
<p>stability of propagation from continuous data. I could select </p>
<p>periods of a few days, or occasionally a fortnight or so, during </p>
<p>which there was no evidence of anomalies in the operation of our </p>
<p>oscillators. At these selected times, the day-to-day repeatability </p>
<p>of the transmission time seemed to be in the neighborhood of two </p>
<p>microseconds in time. This estimate turned out to be approximately </p>
<p>correct, but it was to be several years before I could demonstrate </p>
<p>this fact by an unambiguous experiment.</p>
<p>In the interim, my carefully selected data seemed to show that there </p>
<p>was no characteristic average variation of the time of arrival of </p>
<p>the GBR signal throughout either the daytime or the night-time </p>
<p>hours. The distinctly different transmission times at these periods </p>
<p>were connected by nearly straight lines during the sunrise and </p>
<p>sunset periods, which naturally lasted for five hours or so; the </p>
<p>length of time it takes a sunrise or sunset to cross the Atlantic </p>
<p>Ocean. The result was a somewhat trapezoidal pattern with sunrise </p>
<p>and sunset slopes that varied during the year, as the angle changed </p>
<p>between the sunrise or sunset line and the great circle representing </p>
<p>the transmission path. It later turned out that the nearly uniform </p>
<p>time of transmission during the hours of full daylight was an </p>
<p>unusual condition peculiar to the GBR frequency and the length and </p>
<p>location of the transmission path. It is much more characteristic of </p>
<p>low-frequency propagation in general that the daytime level (of the </p>
<p>time of arrival) is depressed to some degree as the sun gradually </p>
<p>moves higher in the sky, so that there is a broad minimum near the </p>
<p>time when it is noon at the middle of the transmission path.</p>
<p>It did not take long to discover that the sharpest corner of the GBR </p>
<p>diurnal trapezoid when sunrise impinged upon the eastern end of the </p>
<p>transmission path, occurred about 30 minutes before ground-level </p>
<p>sunrise at the point below the nominal first reflection point 500 </p>
<p>miles or so away from the eastern end of the path. The other three </p>
<p>corners were less sharp, especially the one at the end of the sunset </p>
<p>period when the effect of recombination made the return to a full </p>
<p>night-time level somewhat slow. The variation of these observations </p>
<p>as the date changed led to some interesting conclusions about the </p>
<p>detachment and reattachment of free electrons from and to neutral </p>
<p>ions, but these theoretical deductions were perhaps less important </p>
<p>than the fact that, with a little experience, the diurnal variations </p>
<p>in the time of transmission across the Atlantic could be predicted </p>
<p>to within a few microseconds.</p>
<p>These observations and conclusions led me in 1955 to write two </p>
<p>papers that were to be of future importance. One was a general </p>
<p>announcement of the new technique. It surveyed the background and </p>
<p>the results of observation, and gave something of a list of uses to </p>
<p>which this mechanism might become helpful. Emphasis was placed upon </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="radauxomega">The Beginning of Radux-Omega</b> </a>240</p>
<p>the new possibilities for intercomparison of clocks at widely-</p>
<p>separated locations. Applications to radio aids to navigation were </p>
<p>reasonably obvious, at least to me, but were only casually mentioned </p>
<p>in the paper because the whole subject of navigation aids was still </p>
<p>held under military security. I did not choose to violate the spirit </p>
<p>of this decision (with which I violently disagreed) even though such </p>
<p>a newly recognized mechanism could not, of course, be classified in </p>
<p>advance of discovery.</p>
<p>The second paper took the form of a letter report, that could be </p>
<p>classified by the recipient, to the Chief of Naval Research. This </p>
<p>study, called "An Improved Radio Aid to Navigation", reviewed the </p>
<p>work on Radux to that date and called attention to the weaknesses of </p>
<p>that system: especially the limited distance range that could be </p>
<p>served and the magnitude of the typical errors that were already </p>
<p>being recognized as rather larger than would be likely to be </p>
<p>accepted by maritime navigators. The report proposed the addition of </p>
<p>very-low-frequency signals to be radiated by the same antennas. </p>
<p>These signals at, say 10 kHz would be compared in a receiver that </p>
<p>also accepted the Radux signals at 40 or 50 kHz. This composite </p>
<p>system would exhibit the sensitivity and reliability of the 10 kHz </p>
<p>signals, while the increased ambiguity (because the proposed </p>
<p>carrier-frequency period was fifty times smaller than at the Radux </p>
<p>measurement frequency of 200 Hertz) would, it was hoped, be resolved </p>
<p>by the Radux signals. The net result should, I believed, be an </p>
<p>increase of perhaps five times in the accuracy of navigational </p>
<p>measurements.</p>
<p>These suggestions were quickly endorsed by the Navy and some efforts </p>
<p>to this end were soon added to the Radux program at the Navy </p>
<p>Electronics Laboratory and elsewhere. These developments envisaged a </p>
<p>composite system called Radux-Omega. The Omega part was a name I </p>
<p>chose by way of implying that it occupied the furthest end of the </p>
<p>radio wavelength spectrum. More recent naval attempts to improve </p>
<p>communication with submerged submarines may have made this </p>
<p>connotation invalid, although the communication studies have been </p>
<p>concealed by security classification and bedeviled by political </p>
<p>considerations (including, of all things, concern about the health </p>
<p>of earthworms) until it is hard to tell how successful they may be. </p>
<p>Now, if I am asked for a reason for the name, I am more likely to </p>
<p>suggest that it indicates Pierce's absolutely last effort in radio </p>
<p>aids to navigation. I don't suppose I have ever protested much at </p>
<p>the idea that the name connotes the last word, although I realize as </p>
<p>well as anyone that a permanent solution to the navigation problem, </p>
<p>if there ever is one, will probably come from artificial satellites, </p>
<p>if and when costs decrease to make that kind of solution generally </p>
<p>available.</p>
<p><a name="preomega"></a>One of the early pre-Omega attempts at Harvard was the reception of </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p>Pre-Omega Studies</b> 241</p>
<p>a signal from San Diego at a frequency of ten thousand cycles per </p>
<p>second. This frequency is clearly audible to the human ear, as was </p>
<p>shown by an early cartoon sketched by one of the men at San Diego, </p>
<p>labelled Omega Receiver, Mark I, Mod. I, which showed a circuit </p>
<p>diagram consisting of a pair of headphones connected between an </p>
<p>antenna and ground. My reception was done satisfactorily, using the </p>
<p>new cross-correlation technique, although it was possible to radiate </p>
<p>only thirty watts from the small antenna supported by three 625-foot </p>
<p>antenna towers at Chollas Heights. In fact, I was delighted to find </p>
<p>that, with lengthy integration, I could measure the field strength </p>
<p>to a decibel and the relative time of arrival to a microsecond after </p>
<p>the radiated power had been reduced to one watt. Of course no one </p>
<p>seriously proposed a useful system that did not have thousands of </p>
<p>times this power level, but the success of the experiment showed </p>
<p>clearly the great advantages of the very low frequency in range and </p>
<p>reliability.</p>
</font><p><hr>
<font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="measurement"></a></p>
<p>At the time of these studies, we were still recording the time of </p>
<p>arrival of the pulse transmitted once per second from the standard-</p>
<p>frequency station WWV, as part of our continuing study of high </p>
<p>frequency propagation. WWV had not then moved from the Washington, </p>
<p>D.C., area to its later home at Fort Collins, Colorado. Because of </p>
<p>the short path from the transmitter to Cambridge, we were able to </p>
<p>record a good first-hop E layer signal at five megahertz in the </p>
<p>daytime hours. This signal, like the Loran ones of the preceding </p>
<p>decade, was far more stable when reflected from the E layer than </p>
<p>from the higher F layer. As a result, we could measure the relative </p>
<p>time of arrival to about five microseconds; a much greater error </p>
<p>than that at 60 kHz. Even so, measurement of the drift over 24 </p>
<p>hours gave us a standard deviation of the day's average frequency of </p>
<p>about one part in ten billion.</p>
<p>We thus suddenly found ourselves in the position of being able to </p>
<p>intercompare the British and American versions of standard frequency </p>
<p>with an accuracy about a thousand times greater than had been </p>
<p>possible before. Unfortunately, explanation of this fact and its </p>
<p>importance will require a little digression into the methods of </p>
<p>determination of time and frequency that were available in 1955.</p>
<p>The distinction between time and frequency can be made clear by </p>
<p>thinking of an ordinary tall clock. If it is so regulated that its </p>
<p>pendulum beats exactly 86,400 times in a mean solar day, its </p>
<p>frequency is correct. In horological terms it is usual to say that </p>
<p>its rate is right. This exact adjustment of frequency, or period, </p>
<p>has however nothing to do with the time indicated by the hands of </p>
<p>the clock, except that this indication will drift slowly if the rate </p>
<p>is only a little in error. The hands must be set, separately from </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Measurement of Time 242</p>
<p>adjustment of the rate, so that the clock indicates substantial </p>
<p>agreement with some external standard such as a time signal. </p>
<p>Alternatively, it is possible to leave the hands alone and to </p>
<p>account for the clock error by saying, for example, that it has been </p>
<p>gaining 1.3 seconds a day since it was correct on the 23rd of </p>
<p>September. In either case, a means of establishing the correct time </p>
<p>is needed. This intercomparison must be repeated at intervals that </p>
<p>depend upon the stability of the clock and, of course, upon the </p>
<p>required precision of the time measurement. It will be remembered, </p>
<p>for example, that in the early days of Loran it was necessary for </p>
<p>the slave station to readjust the hands of its clock as often as </p>
<p>once or twice a minute in order to maintain the required precision </p>
<p>to a millionth of a second of the clock time with respect to that at </p>
<p>the master station.</p>
<p>It is thus seen that frequency can be measured relative to some </p>
<p>standard without requiring the measurement of the error in the </p>
<p>indication of time. In many cases that need only frequency or rate, </p>
<p>an instrument may have no mechanism for indicating time. A clock, </p>
<p>however, must have such a mechanism. It is therefore technically </p>
<p>incorrect to call an oscillator a clock, although it is often done.</p>
<p>For the thousands of years when the rotation of the earth was the </p>
<p>standard, an instant of time had to be determined by the apparent </p>
<p>motion of some heavenly body, usually the sun or a star. Until a few </p>
<p>centuries ago, the sundial was the most usual measuring device. As </p>
<p>clocks developed and became more accurate, a more precise </p>
<p>measurement was required to set them correctly. This soon took the </p>
<p>form of a transit instrument, eventually using a telescope with </p>
<p>illuminated cross-hairs, to determine the instant at which any one </p>
<p>of a number of standard time stars crossed the meridian of the </p>
<p>observer. When corrected for the known positions of the stars in the </p>
<p>sky and the observer on the earth, this method gave siderial time, </p>
<p>which the astronomers define as the hour angle of the vernal </p>
<p>equinox. This time can be converted into the ordinary mean solar </p>
<p>time by noting that, because the earth completes an orbit around the </p>
<p>sun in exactly one year, the solar or sun time that we customarily, </p>
<p>use loses two hours in the average month, or a little less than four </p>
<p>minutes per day as compared with siderial time.</p>
<p>This digression is important because, even with today's best </p>
<p>instruments, it is impossible to measure the transits of stars in a </p>
<p>single night with a standard deviation less than about five </p>
<p>milliseconds. This permits a daily measurement of the rate of a </p>
<p>clock with a standard deviation of about one or two parts in ten </p>
<p>million. It is only a coincidence that the error in the transmission </p>
<p>of a telegraphic time signal, or one sent by radio, is of about the </p>
<p>same order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Measurement of Time 243</p>
<p>These considerations make it easy to see that for generations the </p>
<p>whole concept of time implied that it could not be standardized with </p>
<p>an accuracy greater than about one part in ten million. This usually </p>
<p>did not worry scientists much because the other fundamental physical </p>
<p>properties of mass, length, and electrical charge could scarcely be </p>
<p>measured with even that relative accuracy.</p>
<p>There was thus a strong feeling that nothing could be measured more </p>
<p>accurately than a part in a few million. This made it hard for the </p>
<p>specialists in time to accept the idea of a large increase in the </p>
<p>precision with which relative frequency could be distributed. In </p>
<p>fact it was two years or more before I could convince the director </p>
<p>of the time service at the Naval Observatory that my measurement of </p>
<p>phase was not something having no relation to his measurement of </p>
<p>time. As soon as the first people in one or two time-standard </p>
<p>laboratories were convinced, however, I found myself operating a </p>
<p>frequency comparison service. This took the form of daily </p>
<p>comparisons of standard-frequency stations (beginning with GBR and </p>
<p>MSF in England and WWV in the United States) that were reported </p>
<p>weekly or monthly to the National Physical Laboratory in England and </p>
<p>to the Bureau of Standards in the United States. As time went on and </p>
<p>the method became more widely appreciated, others were added to the </p>
<p>list of stations and more organizations to the list of recipients.</p>
<p>It was 1964 before there were enough others using my method, or </p>
<p>other new ones, so that I could discontinue this routine service </p>
<p>with a very noticeable sense of relief. </p>

<font face="Courier New" size="2"><p>Explanation of the Table on the Preceding Page 246</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The notation (S203 + 74.36/(10^10)) in the table identifies our </p>
<p>standard oscillator, controlled by an early form of Cesium resonance </p>
<p>and with its rate corrected to agree with what was believed to be </p>
<p>Ephemeris Time.</p>
<p>[NB: Minus sign omitted from all the table values to fit an A4 page]</p>
<p>Ephemeris Time is a time scale which agrees with the movemanta of </p>
<p>the planets and the moons in their orbits, as they are defined in </p>
<p>standard rules developed over long ages of observation. This time </p>
<p>scale is presumed to vary far less than does the rotation of the </p>
<p>earth. </p>
<p>The column headings identify the radio stations observed, as </p>
<p>follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>GBR British Post Office Rugby, England </li>
<li>WWVL Bureau of Standards Fort Collins, Colorado </li>
<li>NBA U.S. Navy Panama Canal Zone </li>
<li>NPM U.S. Navy Lualualei, Hawaii </li>
<li>NAA U.S. Navy Cutler, Maine </li>
<li>NLK U.S. Navy "Jim Creek", Washington </li>
<li>CYZ40 National Observatory Ottawa, Canada </li>
<li>Loran C U.S. Coast Guard Nantucket, Massachusetts </li>
<li>WWVB Bureau of Standards Fort Collins, Colorado</li></ul>

<p>All the measurements are in the region near -130 parts in ten </p>
<p>billion because that was then the difference between a crude </p>
<p>measurement of Ephemeris Time and the frequency of the signals that </p>
<p>were maintained sensibly in agreement with the rotation of the </p>
<p>earth. This distinction will, I hope, be made clearer later on.</p>

<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Cesium">Transatlantic Cesium Clock' Comparisons</b> </a>247</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The earliest and most responsive customer for my observations of </p>
<p>frequency was, naturally, Dr. Essen. The third of his recent </p>
<p>triumphs, that I mentioned above, was the development of a cesium </p>
<p>beam resonator in terms of which he could calibrate the frequency of </p>
<p>oge of his ring oscillators. Dr. Essen used this device for a </p>
<p>passive resonator. So far as I know, Dr. Zacharius at M.I.T. was the </p>
<p>first to use such a resonator with a servomechanism to control the </p>
<p>frequency of a crystal oscillator. This device was, for a time, put </p>
<p>on the market under the trade name "Atomichron". It must be regarded </p>
<p>as the first of the modern atomic clocks. By late 1956, one of these </p>
<p>was in operation at a station in central New York State that was </p>
<p>operated by the Air Force for testing a proposed radio aid to </p>
<p>navigation called Navaglobe that operated at a carrier frequency of </p>
<p>95 kHz.</p>
<p>The existence of this station gave me an opportunity to collaborate </p>
<p>with Dr. Essen in the first international intercomparison of cesium-</p>
<p>controlled oscillators of two kinds of construction. The measurement </p>
<p>network was a little complicated. The MSF signal from Rugby was </p>
<p>received at Teddington and had its frequency measured by Dr. Essen. </p>
<p>The same signal reached Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was measured </p>
<p>against my crystal oscillator. At more or less the same time, my </p>
<p>crystal was rated against the signal from Camden, New York, which </p>
<p>was also measured there in terms of the Atomichron. By </p>
<p>intercomparison of all these measurements it was possible, in </p>
<p>principle, to subtract out all factors except the difference in </p>
<p>frequency between the two cesium devices. Comparisons of this kind </p>
<p>were made on a half a dozen or a dozen days a month on which all the </p>
<p>necessary measurements had been successfully made. The average of </p>
<p>all of these measurements in six months indicated a difference of 4 </p>
<p>parts in 10^10 between the Atomichron and Dr. Essen's resonator, </p>
<p>with a standard deviation also equal to 4/10^10. Dr. Essen was </p>
<p>quite pleased with this demonstration of the good agreement between </p>
<p>the frequencies of the two devices because it was about as close as </p>
<p>his estimate of their absolute accuracy. I was, however, very </p>
<p>disappointed in the magnitude of the standard deviation as I had </p>
<p>published an estimate of 2/10^11 for the available precision of the </p>
<p>daily transatlantic intercomparison, and I hated to announce a </p>
<p>standard deviation 20 times larger than I felt it should be. It was </p>
<p>reasonably obvious that the source of the trouble, if trouble there </p>
<p>were, was because of the unfortunate necessity for making many of </p>
<p>the intercomparisons at different hours of the day. Because this </p>
<p>could not be avoided there was every possibility that the crystal </p>
<p>oscillators were varying diurnally, and that these variations, with </p>
<p>the normal errors of the many measurements, were dominant over the </p>
<p>propagational errors that I had believed I had estimated. I was, of </p>
<p>course, unable to prove this assumption and was left with the </p>
<p>unhappy possibility that I had made an unjustifiable guess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transatlantic Cesium Clock' Comparisons 248</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In spite of my disappointment with our results I joined Dr. Essen </p>
<p>and his assistant in writing a short paper for "Nature" to report </p>
<p>our results. I then began to try to find a way to perform the same </p>
<p>comparison under circumstances that would clearly prove the true </p>
<p>stability of the propagation. As I should have expected, the British </p>
<p>Post Office showed no interest in the idea of acquiring an </p>
<p>Atomichron (necessary because there was as yet no British </p>
<p>equivalent) and using such an untried device to control the </p>
<p>frequencies of their tranmissions.</p>
<p>By 1959 the situation had changed considerably. The Signal Corps of </p>
<p>the U.S. Army had kindly provided us with an Atomichron on loan and </p>
<p>was ready to take another pair to England. With the cooperation of </p>
<p>the Post Office, these were installed at Banbury, within easy </p>
<p>groundwave range of Rugby. Recording equipment that I had provided </p>
<p>then made records using one of the Atomichrons at Banbury that were </p>
<p>identical to mine at Cambridge except for the use of a different </p>
<p>Atomichron and for the long propagation path across the Atlantic. </p>
<p>The results were delightful. Daily values of phase were analysed for </p>
<p>frequency differences. Studied for about a month in September and </p>
<p>October, these showed an average difference of -4.0/10^11 , with a </p>
<p>standard deviation of 2.6/10^11. Simultaneous intercomparisons </p>
<p>between the "operating" and "standby" Atomichrons at Banbury showed </p>
<p>a difference of +6.O/10^11 with a standard deviation of 1.7/10^11. </p>
<p>It thus seemed that not even all of the transatlantic errors ought </p>
<p>to be charged to the propagation link. I was greatly relieved, as </p>
<p>the propagational stability that I had been reporting for four or </p>
<p>five years could no longer be doubted.</p>
<p>My studies of frequency comparisons later had a most curious effect, </p>
<p>possibly at the suggestion of Dr. Essen. At about the time that my </p>
<p>routine reports ended, I was surprised to be notified that I had </p>
<p>been appointed by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures </p>
<p>to a membership on the Consultative Committee for the Definition of </p>
<p>the Second. This appointment was certainly inappropriate. In the </p>
<p>previous years I had learned some useful things about the </p>
<p>distribution of accurate standard frequency, and perhaps even time, </p>
<p>but I had no qualifications that fitted me to judge how the standard </p>
<p>of time should be defined.</p>
<p>On the other hand, membership in the Committee provided such a </p>
<p>pretty feather for my cap that I could not bear to decline the </p>
<p>appointment. The other members were senior officers of standards </p>
<p>laboratories of a dozen nations, about the same number of </p>
<p>representatives of astronomical observatories with a responsibility </p>
<p>for time, such as Greenwich and Neuchatel and three gentlemen from </p>
<p>Innsbruck, Zagreb, and Milan who, like me, were known as "Membres </p>
<p>Nominativement Designes."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><p><hr>
<b><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="three">The Three-Atomichron Experiment</b> </a>249</p>
<p>I had already learned that the most recent revision of the standard </p>
<p>of time represented a total change of philosophy as compared with </p>
<p>the old standard that had, in effect, obtained ever since the clock </p>
<p>had become a more useful timekeeper than a sundial. This change, in </p>
<p>1956, certified final official recognition of the fact that the </p>
<p>rotation of the earth is a poor standard. As noted above, it varies </p>
<p>by a tenth of a second or so with seasonal variables and it also has </p>
<p>sporadic changes of unknown origin. It is an inconvenience, although </p>
<p>one that can be compensated, that the elliptical form of the earth's </p>
<p>orbit makes noon, or the moment when the sun is highest in the sky, </p>
<p>vary as much as plus or minus 16 minutes with respect to the </p>
<p>imaginary mean Sun that is supposed to move uniformly in average </p>
<p>agreement with the true sun throughout a year. The old definition of </p>
<p>a second was 1/86,400th of a mean solar day. This became awkward as </p>
<p>soon as new kinds of clocks began to have a consistency exceeding </p>
<p>that of the earth. The ability to measure a frequency had become </p>
<p>more exact than the stability of the standard.</p>
<p>The people trying to provide for measurement of time and frequency </p>
<p>have always had to serve two masters. On one hand the astronomers </p>
<p>and navigators, always wanted to determine the phase of the earth's </p>
<p>rotation in space. This knowledge permitted the astronomer to </p>
<p>correctly point a telescope at a desired object, or the navigator to </p>
<p>more or less exactly determine longitude. The laboratory scientist, </p>
<p>On the other hand, seldom cared for great accuracy in determining </p>
<p>the time of day but wished for a clock that would measure time </p>
<p>intervals and frequencies with as great accuracy as possible. So </p>
<p>long as neither user had a measuring device as stable as the </p>
<p>rotation of the earth there could be no conflict. Soon after World </p>
<p>War II, however, the physicist's frequency-measuring instruments had </p>
<p>developed accuracy so great that astronomical methods could no </p>
<p>longer measure short time intervals with similar precision. This </p>
<p>brought the problem of the definition of a new time standard to the </p>
<p>fore.</p>
<p>It would be incorrect to say that the laboratory physicists won a </p>
<p>battle, because the astronomers themselves were good physicists and </p>
<p>understood the nature of the problem. In 1956 this was "solved", in </p>
<p>a way, by the definition of the second as the fraction </p>
<p>1/31,556,925.9747 of the length of the tropical year 1900. The long </p>
<p>number is merely the length of the tropical year in seconds, equal </p>
<p>to 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and almost 46 seconds. The </p>
<p>tropical year is the interval from one vernal equinox to the next. </p>
<p>Because this is just an expression of the direction of the line </p>
<p>connecting the centers of the earth and the sun amongst the star; </p>
<p>the instant of the vernal equinox is independent of the phase of the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Ephemeris">Definition of the Second / Ephemeris Time</b> </a>250</p>
<p>earth's rotation on its axis and depends only on the earth's place </p>
<p>in its orbit around the sun. This new definition, therefore, simply </p>
<p>recognised that the unit of time interval (the length of the second) </p>
<p>is independent of the current rate of rotation of the earth.</p>
<p>Of course it was and has remained impossible to go back to measure </p>
<p>precisely the length of the year 1900. That year, incidentally, was </p>
<p>chosen for the definition because it is customary in astronomical </p>
<p>circles to tabulate the place of a star in the sky for the latest, </p>
<p>of the even hundreds of years, and to keep track of any small </p>
<p>subsequent changes in apparent position by appended notes about the </p>
<p>speed and direction of the motion. The 1956 definition was not </p>
<p>realizable; meaning that no other interval could be accurately </p>
<p>compared with it. It did, however, establish the fact that the </p>
<p>definition of the second was henceforth to be a constant, no matter </p>
<p>what changes there might be in the rate of rotation of the earth.</p>
<p>The time scale defined in 1956 is called "Ephemeris Time"; that is, </p>
<p>the time scale at which the motions of the planets and their </p>
<p>satellites fit the "laws" established by observation over long </p>
<p>periods of time. Ephemeris Time and Mean Solar Time would be </p>
<p>identical if all measurements over hundreds of years had had perfect </p>
<p>accuracy, and if the rate of rotation of the earth had not changed </p>
<p>slightly from time to time. Unfortunately, neither of these </p>
<p>desiderata has been fulfilled.</p>
</font><p><hr>
<font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="frequencystandards"></a></p>
<p>At the time my frequency comparisons began, the British and American </p>
<p>systems of time signals were operated in different ways. This </p>
<p>feature added a great deal of interest and amusement to my work. The </p>
<p>Greenwich Observatory tried to define a frequency that would agree </p>
<p>with the rotation of the earth averaged over an entire year. This, </p>
<p>in principle, ought to be constant, but the errors of measurement as </p>
<p>veil as inaccurate estimates of the future speeding up or slowing </p>
<p>down of the earth forced frequent readjustments in an effort to keep </p>
<p>this Greenwich standard in step with the earth on an annual basis. </p>
<p>At times fluctuations were overcorrected and had to be retracted </p>
<p>more or less suddenly. At other times, needed corrections apparently </p>
<p>were not made until too late, when they seemed to became entangled </p>
<p>with other corrections.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Standards in the United States, which broadcast </p>
<p>standard radio frequencies as contrasted to time signals, followed </p>
<p>the Naval Observatory in the opposite philosophy. They tried to </p>
<p>transmit a frequency that stayed in step with the day-to-day </p>
<p>variations in the rotation rate of the earth. This attempt ran afoul </p>
<p>of the limited accuracy with which astronomical time determinations </p>
<p>could be made. It was, in practice, not often that a fairly accurate </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problems in Maintaining Frequency Standards 251</p>
<p>correction could be made more frequently than once in a week or two. </p>
<p>This method seemed to run wild at times and apparently had greater </p>
<p>excursions in frequency than did the British method.</p>
<p>Neither of these technique was really satisfactory. It is </p>
<p>interesting to notice that the Greenwich Observatory was trying to </p>
<p>serve the physicists while the Naval Observatory clung to the </p>
<p>traditional astronomical understanding of time, although I doubt </p>
<p>that either organization would have expressed its philosophy in </p>
<p>those terms. As a result of these varying philosophies, the </p>
<p>difference between the two time systems was often as much as 20 or </p>
<p>30 parts in a billion and occasionally twice that value, at times </p>
<p>when errors accumulated in one or both sources.</p>
<p>These frequency differences were so large that we had to develop </p>
<p>equipment for "offsetting" the frequency of our comparison </p>
<p>oscillator so that we could accurately measure frequencies in both </p>
<p>systems. Such a device, in those predigital days, consisted of an </p>
<p>electronic phase-shifter rotated at a carefully-selected rate by a </p>
<p>synchronous motor. With change gears or some other mechanism a </p>
<p>frequency-changer could be adjusted to any desired rate. An </p>
<p>oscillator could, say, be operated nearly in synchronism with the </p>
<p>GBR signal so that a precise measurement could be made over a </p>
<p>relatively long interval. The output of the same oscillator could be </p>
<p>shifted by an exact amount to produce coherence with a second </p>
<p>signal, say from WWV. If and when desired, a phase-locked loop could </p>
<p>be established so that the oscillator tuning would automatically be </p>
<p>kept in agreement with one signal or another, It was, however, </p>
<p>usually much more satisfactory to leave the oscillator entirely </p>
<p>alone, except to correct for its variations manually on infrequent </p>
<p>occasions, if at all.</p>
<p>It is obvious that my reports could not be sent to Washington and to </p>
<p>England for very long without stimulating a desire to make the </p>
<p>standard-frequency signals more coherent. The major change came when </p>
<p>the Naval Observatory and the Bureau of Standards adopted the </p>
<p>annual-mean-frequency concept. For a year or two thereafter, </p>
<p>although no one would admit it, I am sure that the frequency </p>
<p>adjustments at WWV were made largely in response to the errors shown </p>
<p>in my reports. The evidence for this opinion was a noticeable </p>
<p>tendency for a large reported discrepancy to be followed by a </p>
<p>corresponding correction; and this was at a time when (so far as I </p>
<p>know) there were no other observations than mine that could yield </p>
<p>equal precision so promptly. A year or two later some of the </p>
<p>standards laboratories had adopted my method of comparison of </p>
<p>carrier phase and my reports became only one of several available </p>
<p>kinds of evidence for needed changes. In any case, by the early </p>
<p>1960s the more general availability of the first cesium-controlled </p>
<p>"clocks" made the problem far simpler. These devices had a </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="Consultive">The Consultative Committee</b> </a>252</p>
<p>stability, even in those early days, some hundred or more times that </p>
<p>of the best crystal oscillators. This made intercomparisons feasible </p>
<p>over longer intervals with a corresponding improvement in precision. </p>
<p>With further development these "atomic clocks" have become so </p>
<p>improved that now a group of several of them will keep time with an </p>
<p>error as small as a millionth of a second per year -- a timing </p>
<p>precision as exact over a year as my best sources could maintain for </p>
<p>a day.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>After these lengthy digressions, I should return to the Consultative </p>
<p>Committee. As intimated before, I did not decline the appointment. </p>
<p>I had, however, a sufficiently keen appreciation of how little I </p>
<p>could contribute so that I did not try to get anyone to pay for a </p>
<p>trip to Paris. Such a trip would have been useless, in any case, </p>
<p>because the problem facing the committee soon turned out to be a </p>
<p>little intricate. As a result, after only one meeting following my </p>
<p>appointment it was decided to continue the discussions, or </p>
<p>arguments, by correspondence. My contributions thereafter were in </p>
<p>the form of talks with the Naval Observatory and Bureau of Standards </p>
<p>experts, and with academic and commercial specialists who could </p>
<p>speak with authority about the characteristics of at least two kinds </p>
<p>of atomic clocks.</p>
<p>The choice between these, the cesium-beam resonator and the hydrogen </p>
<p>maser, took some little time but was not really a difficult decision </p>
<p>to make. The cesium resonator had the characteristic that two of </p>
<p>them of different form and size had, within reasonable limits, a </p>
<p>strong tendency to operate at equal frequencies. The hydrogen maser, </p>
<p>an even newer device, could maintain a uniform frequency more </p>
<p>accurately but its frequency was sensitive to the size of its </p>
<p>resonant cavity. It could be adjusted to agree, for example, with </p>
<p>some other reference such as a cesium clock. In spite of the greater </p>
<p>stability of the maser, it was obviously less appropriate for a </p>
<p>standard. It also seemed inadvisable to wait for an indefinite </p>
<p>period to see whether the maser might ultimately achieve better </p>
<p>absolute accuracy.</p>
<p>A much more difficult and interesting series of questions arose from </p>
<p>the fact that the precision of clocks had now reached the level at </p>
<p>which time was noticeably affected by relativity. The more ordinary </p>
<p>concepts of relative speed were obviously not a concern of the </p>
<p>committee, but the problem of gravitational potential caused a good </p>
<p>deal of discussion. The rate of any clock is affected by what may </p>
<p>crudely be called the force of gravity upon it. It follows that the </p>
<p>rate of a clock depends upon the place on earth (or in space) in </p>
<p>which it is operated. In principle, the rate should be the same at </p>
<p>all points on the surface of the geoid, which is the figure the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="moon">The Moon Camera</b> </a>253</p>
<p>earth would have if it were completely homogenous and plastic. In </p>
<p>practice, no one really knows how far a real point on the surface of </p>
<p>the earth may be above or below the surface of the geoid. Thus a </p>
<p>definition that included the effect of gravitational potential would </p>
<p>have to specify the second as a particular interval measured by a </p>
<p>particular clock when operated at a particular point on earth. Such </p>
<p>a definition is clearly untenable because the rate of the "standard" </p>
<p>clock would change when it was moved from place to place. The </p>
<p>committee was, after much discussion and correspondence, forced to </p>
<p>escape the problem of relativity by not mentioning it, at least in </p>
<p>the definition, and leaving it to the user of every fine clock to </p>
<p>determine for himself the effects of relativity upon his own </p>
<p>measurements.</p>
<p>It remained to define the second itself. It was relatively easy to </p>
<p>intercompare the frequency of the chosen cesium resonance with the </p>
<p>ordinary men solar second, but, almost by definition, this second </p>
<p>would no longer suffice even for purposes of calibration. The length </p>
<p>of the solar second was, as a matter of fact, changing by about five </p>
<p>parts in a billion per year in the 1955-1958 period. It happened </p>
<p>that Dr. William Markowitz at the U. S. Naval Observatory had </p>
<p>developed a "moon camera" that was really a complete technique for </p>
<p>photographing the moon in a field of stars, and then measuring the </p>
<p>negative to give the position of the moon with remarkable precision. </p>
<p>His method amounted to a clever optical technique for taking a </p>
<p>"snap-shot" photograph of the moon against a background made with a </p>
<p>long time exposure. Thus the moon's image could be seen without </p>
<p>overexposure among a considerable number of faint stars. On the </p>
<p>glass-plate negative, an approximate center of the moon's image was </p>
<p>marked. From this point a dividing engine measured the distance to </p>
<p>each star, noting the distance to the edge of the moon along the </p>
<p>way. Subsequent calculation removed any error in marking the center </p>
<p>of the moon's image and yielded the position of the moon in the </p>
<p>ordinary celestial coordinates. Dr. Markowitz's measurements were so </p>
<p>good that the position of the moon was determined with a standard </p>
<p>deviation of no more than 1/4 second of time; a remarkable </p>
<p>achievement when one considers the stately rate of progression of </p>
<p>the moon among the stars. It amounted to measuring the position </p>
<p>within a ten-thousandth of the apparent diameter of the moon.</p>
<p>I said above that Ephemeris Time has to be measured in terms of the </p>
<p>motion of bodies of the solar system in their orbits. In theory this </p>
<p>is fine; in practice the "hands" of these clocks move very slowly. </p>
<p>For example, Mars, the "speediest" planet that seems to travel </p>
<p>completely around the heavens, would have to have its period </p>
<p>measured to about six milliseconds of time to achieve an accuracy of </p>
<p>one part in ten billion. Clearly this cannot be done without </p>
<p>measuring over hundreds of periods, which means even more hundreds </p>
<p>of years. Fortunately, the moon moves across the sky about 25 times </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Moon Camera 254</p>
<p>as rapidly, so that there is hope of reaching a precision of a part </p>
<p>in ten billion in the measurement of Ephemeris Time within a few </p>
<p>decades.</p>
<p>Dr. Markowitz's excellent measurements were carried on and </p>
<p>intercompared with Dr. Essen's cesium frequency standard from June, </p>
<p>1955, to March, 1958. At that date these gentlemen announced an </p>
<p>average value of 9,192,631,770 Hz (cycles per second) for the </p>
<p>frequency of the cesium resonance in terms of Ephemeris Time. This </p>
<p>value is tentative, as the uncertainty figure of plus or minus 20 </p>
<p>cycles per second is far larger than one would desire. Up to the </p>
<p>time when the Committee for the Definition of the Second was </p>
<p>deliberating, this estimate had not been amended. It was then </p>
<p>necessarily adopted by the Committee and, in October, 1967, by the </p>
<p>Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The new definition is: </p>
<p>"The second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the </p>
<p>radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine </p>
<p>levels of the ground state of the atom of cesium 133" [translation </p>
<p>from the French by JAP]. It will undoubtedly remain the standard for </p>
<p>some decades although ultimately it will be advisable to refine it </p>
<p>or change it.</p>
<p>The only real inconvenience in having a time standard that is </p>
<p>inaccurately defined is this. It is advisable, for obvious reasons, </p>
<p>to transmit the time signals used for all ordinary purposes in terms </p>
<p>of Universal (or mean solar) time. One second is being added to the </p>
<p>time signals at the beginning of each year. </p>
<p>Occasionally a correction of 1 second is made at the end of June </p>
<p>rather than at the end of December. The interval between corrections </p>
<p>can thus be made in some multiple of six utonths, in an effort to </p>
<p>keep the time signals within a half second of Mean Solar Time.</p>
<p>The effect is that the minute before midnight Greenwich Time on </p>
<p>December 31st seems to have 61 seconds in it, if one judges by </p>
<p>listening to the time signals. This adjustment is to be made only </p>
<p>when necessary to keep the two kinds of time close together. The </p>
<p>decision is made by the Bureau International de l'Heure and the </p>
<p>change is made simultaneously in the time signals of all nations. </p>
<p>Most time signals indicate by a number of double ticks, or some such </p>
<p>audible signal transmitted at chosen intervals, how many tenths of </p>
<p>seconds should be added to or subtracted from the atomic time to get </p>
<p>a somewhat better approximation to Mean Solar Time.</p>
<p>Under this system any people desiring Ephemeris Time accurately must </p>
<p>fend for themselves; but as that standard can not be accurately </p>
<p>known for a long time, this creates no great inconvenience.</p>
<p>I should beg forgiveness for running on in so much detail about a </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>matter for which I had no great responsibility. My only excuse is </p>
<p>that the subject interests me; but then, that is my only excuse for </p>

<b><p><a name="memorable">Two Memorable Concerts</a></p>
</b><p>In 1956 the American Academy of Arts and Sciences gave itself a </p>
<p>concert that was both technically interesting and musically </p>
<p>delightful. It was planned and arranged to celebrate Franklin's </p>
<p>250th anniversary and Mozart's 200th, and had been in preparation </p>
<p>for at least two or three years. Two important members of the </p>
<p>committee that planned and prepared the concert were, I am sure, the </p>
<p>originators of the original idea. They were the curiously matched </p>
<p>team of Barlow Shapley, the astronomer, and E. Power Biggs, the </p>
<p>organist.</p>
<p>It seems that in that decade there was an idea current among some </p>
<p>musicians that there must once have been Glass Armonicas that were </p>
<p>played from keyboards. This idea, I gathered, arose from </p>
<p>contemplation of the technical character of some music written for </p>
<p>the Armonica; a concept I am unable to discuss and one that I think </p>
<p>must now have been abandoned.</p>
<p>The Glass Armonica was one of Benjamin Franklin's minor but happy </p>
<p>inventions. He had observed the playing of musical glasses by </p>
<p>rubbing wettened fingers along their rims and had been, like many </p>
<p>another, charmed by their etherial tones. Being Franklin, he also </p>
<p>noticed that they were played in an awkward and impractical way. He </p>
<p>therefore had a series of glass bowls made in such shapes that they </p>
<p>could be nested closely together, bored holes in their centers, and </p>
<p>mounted them on an axle to form a sort of tapered cylinder. The </p>
<p>bowls were blown or ground so that they resonated at the frequencies </p>
<p>of the notes in the musical scale. This assembly was mounted </p>
<p>horizontally in a case with a mechanism (like that later used for </p>
<p>the treadle-operated sewing machine) that would keep the assembly of </p>
<p>bowls rotating. The edges of the bowls were thus exposed with </p>
<p>spacings about like those of the keys of a harpsichord. A tray of </p>
<p>water was provided along the front of the instrument so that the </p>
<p>fingers of the musician could be made wetter whenever required. The </p>
<p>new instrument could thus be played almost as though it had a </p>
<p>keyboard,. but with one important difference. It is characteristic </p>
<p>of a series of resonators that emit very pure tones that accidental </p>
<p>variations may make the various notes either easy or hard to excite. </p>
<p>With Franklin's Glass Armonica any of these differences between </p>
<p>various notes of the scale could be accomodated by adjusting the </p>
<p>contact of the finger on the edge of each bowl or, to express it </p>
<p>crudely, by pressing harder until the note came out clearly.</p>
<p>There was a period, chiefly in the latter part of the eighteenth </p>
<p>century, when Franklin's Armonica was very popular, as indeed it </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="glass">The New Glass Armonica</b> </a>257</p>
<p>deserved to be, although this interest, we may be sure, arose in </p>
<p>part from the fame and popularity of Franklin himself. Music for </p>
<p>this instrument was written by many of the composers of that era, </p>
<p>and Mozart left a considerable repertoire of music for it. It later </p>
<p>fell into disuse, probably because of its fragility and the need for </p>
<p>a talented and devoted artisan to produce glass bowls of good </p>
<p>quality and accurate tuning. I am told that in this century there </p>
<p>are the remains of Glass Armonicas in several museums but that there </p>
<p>is now no evidence of any that might have been played from a </p>
<p>keyboard.</p>
<p>Apparently the musical opinion that there must have been such an </p>
<p>instrument was strong enough to generate a proposal to build one. </p>
<p>This idea was adopted by the Academy and the development of the </p>
<p>instrument led to the concert in 1956.</p>
<p>The American Academy of Arts and Sciences has a happy characteristic </p>
<p>of doing everything well. I remember a time when it went through a </p>
<p>considerable effort to amend its constitution because someone had </p>
<p>discovered a more apt preposition to use at one place in the </p>
<p>document. The decision to have a modern Glass Armonica built was </p>
<p>carried out in this spirit, although it was also characteristic of </p>
<p>the Academy to have the work financially supported by a large Boston </p>
<p>bank. It was decided that the Steuben Glass factory at Corning, New </p>
<p>York, would blow the crystal bowls which would be ground to the </p>
<p>correct pitches using the most modern electronic measurement </p>
<p>techniques. The machine would be assembled and cased by Herman </p>
<p>Schlicker, a famous organ builder in Buffalo. A keyboard mechanism </p>
<p>was devised that would bring rosined pads of leather gently against </p>
<p>the edges of the bowls when keys were pressed, and it was hoped that </p>
<p>enough sensitivity to increasing pressure would remain to let the </p>
<p>bowls speak properly.</p>
<p>For the year or two before the concert, one of the more interesting </p>
<p>reports at each monthly meeting of the Academy was a statement about </p>
<p>the status of the Armonica. It was to be expected that a few glass </p>
<p>bowls would speak so vigorously as to shatter under a small </p>
<p>stimulus, as indeed often happened. The set was to consist of </p>
<p>thirty-seven bowls, each responding to a separate key. A typical </p>
<p>report might be that thirty or more had been working well but that </p>
<p>three had shattered in the course of the month. The count would work </p>
<p>its way gradually upward, but with some disappointing reverses. </p>
<p>Opinion in the Academy was sharply divided on the question of </p>
<p>whether an entire set of satisfactory bowls would ever be in </p>
<p>existence at the same time, to say nothing of being right on the day </p>
<p>of the concert. I do not recall any report being made in which the </p>
<p>count of successful bowls did not lack two or three. Steuben Glass </p>
<p>must have become weary of this project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The New Glass Armonica 258</p>
<p>I can think of little that would have prevented Catherine and me </p>
<p>from attending on the night of the concert. Because exact details of </p>
<p>the program had not been announced in advance, we realized that the </p>
<p>Glass Armonica had not been entirely successful only when we found </p>
<p>that that instrument had been demoted from a major attraction to a </p>
<p>kind of entr'acte. The remainder of the concert, however, left no </p>
<p>room for complaint. A fine string quartet had been drawn from </p>
<p>members of the Boston Symphony, primarily to play Mozart. Roland </p>
<p>Hayes, whom I recalled had been one of Mother's favorite tenors, had </p>
<p>been persuaded to leave his retirement to sing a number of songs for </p>
<p>which Franklin had written the words.</p>
<p>Mr. Biggs gave an interesting discussion of the musical glasses and </p>
<p>of the development of the Armonica. He played skillfully on the old </p>
<p>fashioned glasses and then gave us two or three short selections on </p>
<p>the Armonica, which was a beautiful instrument. Mr. Biggs had to be </p>
<p>apologetic about the success of the project as a small number of </p>
<p>notes were missing from the scale. This was presumably the reason </p>
<p>for choosing only short and carefully selected bits that could be </p>
<p>played without needing the missing tones. Even under this small </p>
<p>amount of use, two bowls were heard to break during the performance, </p>
<p>but Mr. Biggs, being an expert musician, was able to change key or </p>
<p>otherwise avoid having to use the missing notes again, so that his </p>
<p>selections were completed without further obvious defects. The tone </p>
<p>quality of the instrument was, as expected, a true delight, although </p>
<p>it had to be admitted that the experiment as a whole was not </p>
<p>successful.</p>
<p>To us, and probably to many of the audience, the most fascinating </p>
<p>part of the concert was the playing by the quartet of a piece for </p>
<p>strings actually composed by Franklin. His genius was such that it </p>
<p>had to modify even the way of playing chamber music by a quartet. </p>
<p>Franklin had obviously felt that the conventional way of playing </p>
<p>stringed instruments was too complicated for ordinary practical </p>
<p>people. He had therefore caused the instruments to be retuned so </p>
<p>that one player or another had every note that would be required on </p>
<p>an open string. The violinists and the viola player therefore had </p>
<p>nothing to do with their left hands except to hold up the necks of </p>
<p>their instruments. It was especially amusing to watch Alfred </p>
<p>Zighers, the cellist, bowing away with his left hand resting on his </p>
<p>thigh and a broad grin on his face. It is a curious and unexpected </p>
<p>fact that, to us at least, there was nothing whatever wrong with the </p>
<p>simple music. It seemed to be perfectly standard eighteenth century </p>
<p>chamber music with no smell of the artisan about it.</p>
<p>This concert could not fail to satisfy a selected audience having an </p>
<p>interest in academic matters. Most of the members certainly </p>
<p>remembered with sentimental affection the unbounded delight with </p>
<p>which Roland Hayes had accepted this introduction as a new Fellow of </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="concert">The Academy Concert</b> </a>259</p>
<p>the Academy a year or two before, If on that occasion he had felt as </p>
<p>much gratitude to the Fellows of the Academy as he seemed to show, </p>
<p>in 1956 he repaid the favor in overflowing measure. I doubt that he </p>
<p>ever sang acre beautifully. Although he must have had greater </p>
<p>technical control in his younger days, he could not have conveyed </p>
<p>more meaning and beauty to an audience. The rapport between the </p>
<p>quartet and the audience was distinctly marked and I suspect that I </p>
<p>have never heard chamber music better played. And the Franklinian </p>
<p>components of the concert were so characteristic of the man that </p>
<p>they brought his memory into our hearts with even more respect and </p>
<p>affection than it had received before.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>We had attended an equally memorable and more formal concert in </p>
<p>1955. This one celebrated the eightieth birthday of Pierre Monteux, </p>
<p>who had been the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra after </p>
<p>World War I and an honored guest conductor from time to time ever </p>
<p>since. It was reported that someone had asked him what he would like </p>
<p>for a birthday present, to which he had replied that he would like </p>
<p>to conduct the Boston Symphony and play Beethoven. It happened that </p>
<p>the date was one on which the Pension Fund concert could be held, so </p>
<p>everything was arranged according to M. Monteux's desire.</p>
<p>His presence of course guaranteed a hall crowded with his well-</p>
<p>wishers, a group that obviously included the musicians. M. Monteux </p>
<p>conducted an all'Beethoven concert of surpassing beauty. The </p>
<p>sentiments of the players and the audience were deeply involved. The </p>
<p>orchestra played magnificently and an audience never seeped more </p>
<p>appreciative.</p>
<p>At the end of the concert proper, the President of the Trustees made </p>
<p>the appropriate speech of thanks and appreciation and presented M. </p>
<p>Monteux with a bound volume of testimonies that seemed to be at </p>
<p>least four inches thick. To conclude the evening the music director </p>
<p>of the Symphony, Charles Munch, appeared to conduct two pieces </p>
<p>composed especially for the occasion. The first was by Darius </p>
<p>Milhaud and seemed a bit too modern to appeal greatly to Catherine </p>
<p>and me. The final composition of the evening, by Igor Stravinsky, </p>
<p>was introduced under the impressive title, Commemorative Ode for the </p>
<p>Eightieth Birthday of Pierre Monteux. M. Munch staged this </p>
<p>performance extremely well. He posed rigidly with both arms extended </p>
<p>upward and well apart until the silence of the audience had changed </p>
<p>to tension. He then suddenly began a complex and violent series of </p>
<p>motions that invoked a remarkable noise that seemed to roll across </p>
<p>the orchestra from right to left, lasting perhaps fifteen seconds. </p>
<p>As silence fell, M. Munch resumed his pose and again produced a </p>
<p>strange sequence of chords and disohords with a somewhat different </p>
<p>modulation. Silence fell once more and the effect, revised and </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="bday">The 80th Birthday of Pierre Monteux</b> </a>260</p>
<p>perhaps improved, was repeated for the third time.</p>
<p>This was all so cleverly done that it was only during the third </p>
<p>variation that any significant portion of the audience realized that </p>
<p>these cacophonous sounds were simply Stravinsky burlesquing </p>
<p>Stravinsky, and that the melody that had been so deeply buried was </p>
<p>nothing more than Happy Birthday to You. The audience burst into </p>
<p>shouts of laughter and applause, and the evening ended on a note of </p>
<p>high approval that I have never heard equalled. The effect persisted </p>
<p>for some time as, while walking along Westland Avenue to reach our </p>
<p>car, our expressions of delight were frequently interrupted by </p>
<p>outbursts of laughter from groups ahead of or behind us, or even </p>
<p>from the opposite side of the street. All in all, this was the </p>
<p>happiest occasion with about the finest music that we have heard in </p>
<p>Symphony Hall.</p>

<b><p><a name="draco">Draco</a></p>
</b><p>Having followed the fortunes of frequency measurement for about a </p>
<p>decade, I must go back in time to describe my first efforts to </p>
<p>devise a practical aid to navigation using the very low radio </p>
<p>frequencies.</p>
<p>It may have been as early as the days in the Radiation Laboratory </p>
<p>when I began to talk about what I then called the phaseless phase </p>
<p>navigation method. Discussion of this topic was purely as a tutorial </p>
<p>device, because it seemed clearly impossible that such a method </p>
<p>could exist in the real world; The idea was a development from a </p>
<p>possibility that later became known as "rho-rho", or distance </p>
<p>measurement. This earlier "impossible" concept suggested that a </p>
<p>vehicle should carry a perfect oscillator against which it could </p>
<p>observe a signal derived from an equally perfect oscillator and </p>
<p>transmitted from a known position. Changes in distance from the </p>
<p>transmitter would then be measured by changes in the observed phase </p>
<p>of the signal, and integration of these phase changes would (if the </p>
<p>velocity of propagation were accurately known) always indicate the </p>
<p>distance of the vessel from the transmitter, provided that an </p>
<p>initial phase had been measured at a known starting point. Without </p>
<p>this calibration at a known place, the method would show little, and </p>
<p>it was obviously necessary that the signal should be tracked </p>
<p>continuously after this definition of the starting point. It was </p>
<p>clearly impossible in the 1940s that such a rho-rho system could be </p>
<p>successful, as the best oscillators, even when operated under </p>
<p>carefully controlled conditions in the laboratory, would surely have </p>
<p>errors corresponding to a fictitious rate of at least a mile an </p>
<p>hour, while it would obviously be prohibitively expensive, even if </p>
<p>possible, to attain such accuracy in a moving vehicle.</p>
<p>The phaseless phase concept suggested a way of eliminating </p>
<p>oscillator drift as a problem. It proposed that two transmitters </p>
<p>(controlled by good oscillators that were kept coherent by frequent </p>
<p>or continuous monitoring) should radiate two different frequencies </p>
<p>whose only limitation was that it should not be too complex a </p>
<p>problem accurately to derive both frequencies from the same </p>
<p>oscillator. A vehicle would then carry separate receivers and phase </p>
<p>trackers for these two frequencies. Each of these phase change </p>
<p>summations could then be multiplied by an appropriate factor to </p>
<p>reduce the measurement to that which would have been observed at </p>
<p>some convenient reference frequency. The measurement would then be </p>
<p>one of the total change in the difference of the distances from the </p>
<p>two transmitters, This line of position could, like that in any </p>
<p>other hyperbolic system, be crossed by one or more other lines </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>262</p>
<p>produced by observation of other stations. Like the rho-rho idea, </p>
<p>the phaseless-phase mechanism would not yield absolute position, but </p>
<p>only the distance and direction travelled since, the navigator had </p>
<p>been at a known place.</p>
<p>A little thought reveals the fact that this kind of mechanism is </p>
<p>nothing but a form of dead-reckoning tracker, with the peculiar and </p>
<p>important property that the errors with which position is carried </p>
<p>forward are limited to those of measurement and propagation. In </p>
<p>conventional dead reckoning, on the other hand, the errors can grow </p>
<p>without limit, more or less in proportion to the length of time </p>
<p>since the position was determined. This difference is of </p>
<p>philosophical interest, and it justified some discussion of this </p>
<p>method even when there was no known mechanism for reducing it to </p>
<p>practice.</p>
<p>After the unexpected discovery of the great predictability of the </p>
<p>very-low-frequency propagation velocity, the phaseless-phase idea </p>
<p>suddenly seemed capable of implementation. One of the powerful </p>
<p>arguments for this system stemmed from the fact that there were a </p>
<p>number of wireless telegraph stations operating in the region from </p>
<p>15 to 25 or 30 kilohertz. Some of these had quite high power and all </p>
<p>of them, in those days, used on-and-off keying in morse code. It was </p>
<p>clear that if some of these stations could be taught to keep their </p>
<p>signals flowing even if they had nothing to say (and if their </p>
<p>operating, frequencies could be made coherent, that is, in exact </p>
<p>mathematical ratio) one or more ready-made navigational pairs could </p>
<p>be set up without great expense. This we set out to do. </p>
<p>In promoting such an idea, it was obviously necessary to have a name </p>
<p>for the system. For this I chose Draco because, as I have always </p>
<p>believed, if a name has as yet no denotation it should at least have </p>
<p>some connotation. In my mind, at least, the two first letters </p>
<p>symbolized the dead-reckoning tracker that I recognized the system </p>
<p>to be, while the word draco (Latin for dragon or serpent) suggested </p>
<p>the train of sine waves that was the output waveform of each </p>
<p>station. Now that I come to write about it, I realize that it is </p>
<p>possible that I never before explained this origin.</p>
<p>The circumstances for this experiment were auspicious. We knew that </p>
<p>GBR operated about 23 hours per day and, except for a maintenance </p>
<p>period, seldom fell silent for more than a few seconds at a time. It </p>
<p>would certainly provide a useful signal over long distances. With </p>
<p>this as a master station, it only remained to build the machinery </p>
<p>that would use the Rugby signal to lock a good oscillator from which </p>
<p>the operating frequency of some other station could be derived. Thus </p>
<p>an experiment could be performed using Rugby as a master station. </p>
<p>Its operators would need to take no action, although it would </p>
<p>certainly be a courtesy to advise them of what would be going on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="philosophy">Draco Philosophy</b> </a>263</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the time we had decided to test this idea, the discouraging news </p>
<p>was received that the Rugby station, or at least the 16 kilohertz </p>
<p>transmitter, would fall silent for several months or more to permit </p>
<p>reconstruction of its antenna. This was a complex structure of wire </p>
<p>cables and insulators supported by a dozen or more 820-foot towers. </p>
<p>During the long silent interval, the important communication </p>
<p>function would be transferred to a standby station at Criggion, </p>
<p>Wales. This station would transmit at much the same schedule but at </p>
<p>a slightly less favorable frequency and with only one-sixth of the </p>
<p>radiated power of Rugby.</p>
<p>I did not feel that this change could be allowed to delay our </p>
<p>experiment, so construction of equipment to receive and use the new </p>
<p>frequency was begun. The most convenient station to make a slave was </p>
<p>at a place called Jim Creek in the town of Arlington, not near </p>
<p>Washington, D.C., but somewhat north of Seattle, Washington, in the </p>
<p>foothills of the Cascade Mountains. This was, at the time, the </p>
<p>Navy's most powerful VLF transmitter. Its acceptance trials had </p>
<p>shown a radiated power of 330 kilowatts, but it had been found more </p>
<p>satisfactory to run the station at the 200-kilowatt level, as this </p>
<p>allowed less frequent interruptions and replacement of components.</p>
<p>The great circle path from Criggion to Jim Creek is a little less </p>
<p>than 5,000 miles in length, but it arcs northward to cross the </p>
<p>Greenland ice-cap and then traverse a thousand miles or more of the </p>
<p>permafrost region of Canada, north and west of Hudson's Bay. Both </p>
<p>kinds of frozen terrain were believed (and later proved) to cause </p>
<p>great attenuation of low frequency signals. We had, however, </p>
<p>confidence in our improving techniques for signal integration and we </p>
<p>felt that we could deal with extremely weak radio signals.</p>
<p>There were two major problems to be faced in the design of our </p>
<p>equipment. One was to assure maximum stability in the many necessary </p>
<p>selective circuits, so that changes in temperature or in the </p>
<p>characteristics of vacuum tubes would not cause phase shifts that </p>
<p>would vary with time. This was required as there was no definable </p>
<p>reference phase. It was therefore necessary to arrange things so </p>
<p>that, whatever relation an output phase had with respect to an </p>
<p>incoming signal, it could be expected to remain constant, at least </p>
<p>over the length of time, it would take a navigator to go from one </p>
<p>known place to another.</p>
<p>This requirement was met, as far as possible, by designing </p>
<p>frequency-adding or frequency-dividing circuits that required a </p>
<p>minimum of filtering to produce the necessary purity of tone. This </p>
<p>work had three parts planning, so that a needed frequency was </p>
<p>removed as far as possible from all unwanted by-products; </p>
<p>development of circuits that added or subtracted to produce the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="plans">Plans for a Draco Pair of Stations</b> </a>264</p>
<p>desired sum or difference frequency at a power level much higher </p>
<p>than that of any other frequency present; and use of lattice filters </p>
<p>with bandwidths as broad as circumstances permitted rather than </p>
<p>sharply-tuned selective circuits that would be more sensitive to </p>
<p>changes in the temperature of components. The final equipment, which </p>
<p>filled a large relay rack, was certainly the most carefully designed </p>
<p>and built that we ever made.</p>
<p>The second major problem was really a series, all of which stemmed </p>
<p>from the tremendous local signal that would be received on the </p>
<p>station premises from the Jim Creek transmitter itself, as compared </p>
<p>with an extremely weak signal to be expected from Criggion. Before </p>
<p>going to the Seattle area, we had no idea how weak this signal might </p>
<p>be, so we prepared for the worst and made the equipment as sensitive </p>
<p>as we possibly could. It was well that we did so, for the signal </p>
<p>turned out to be only about a microvolt per meter, which may be </p>
<p>compared with the hundred or more microvolts per meter commonly </p>
<p>required for a useful morse code signal, The Jim Creek signal was at </p>
<p>least as big an obstacle as expectad. It was found to be about </p>
<p>4,000 volts per meter at the best location we could find on the </p>
<p>station property. There was thus a voltage difference of about four </p>
<p>billion to one in favor of the unwanted signal in our receiver. The </p>
<p>ratio of the power inputs was even more fantastic, being over a </p>
<p>quintillion times greater for the unwanted signal. In technical </p>
<p>terms, it would be necessary to provide enough frequency selectivity </p>
<p>to reduce the unwanted signal by more than 200 decibels, because </p>
<p>that signal would have to be reduced to negligibility with respect </p>
<p>to the wanted one. Some idea of the meaning of this ratio can be </p>
<p>gained by realizing that it is more than twice the logarithmic </p>
<p>difference between the loudest noise the ear can tolerate and the </p>
<p>most delicate sound that can be heard at all.</p>
<p>The problem of attaining adequate selectivity was made somewhat more </p>
<p>difficult for the signal from Criggion, as that frequency was closer </p>
<p>to that of Jim Creek than was the Rugby signal's. Criggion operated </p>
<p>at 19.6 khz and Jim Creek at 18.6 khz. There was thus a difference </p>
<p>of only 1,000 cycles per second between the wanted and unwanted </p>
<p>signals in the receiver. It is perhaps more appropriate to say that </p>
<p>the ratio of the two frequencies was almost the equivalent of one </p>
<p>semitone in the musical scale.</p>
<p>To attain the great degree of selectivity that was required, it </p>
<p>would be necessary to use, at least in the first tuned circuits, </p>
<p>coils having a figure of merit (called Q) of at least 250 or 300. At </p>
<p>least in 1956, the best available Q in physically small inductors </p>
<p>was of the order of 200 or more, but was attained by the use of </p>
<p>windings on toroidal iron cores. It would be impossible to use such </p>
<p>inductors in the earlier tuned circuits in our receiver because they </p>
<p>became non-linear when the iron was magnetically saturated by too </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="more">More Equipment Problems</b> </a>265</p>
<p>great a current in the coil. This would lead to a change in </p>
<p>inductance and a phase shift in the tuned circuit. This possibility </p>
<p>was not tolerable because it would mean that the receiver output </p>
<p>would have a different phase when the Jim Creek key was down than </p>
<p>when it was up. In other words, the phase of the observed Criggion </p>
<p>signal would vary, depending upon the duty'cycle of Jim Creek; or, </p>
<p>crudely, upon whether it was transmitting mostly dots or mostly </p>
<p>dashes at a given time.</p>
<p>The solution for this problem was to construct air-cored inductors </p>
<p>that had adequate Q without iron. By using Litz (or Litzendraht) </p>
<p>wire composed of dozens or hundreds of fine wires, the </p>
<p>radio-frequency resistance could be kept low, while making the coils </p>
<p>larger increased the figure of merit. After some experimentation, we </p>
<p>learned to make multilayer solenoids that were six or more inches </p>
<p>long and about four inches in diameter. To protect these inductors </p>
<p>from outside, possibly nonlinear, influences, each of the coils was </p>
<p>installed in the middle of a copper box containing something more </p>
<p>than a cubic foot of air. These shielding boxes were provided with </p>
<p>electric heaters and thermostats and were thermally insulated from </p>
<p>the environment, so that temperature changes and consequent phase </p>
<p>shifts could be minimized. By making the first two tuned circuits in </p>
<p>the receiver with these cumbersome components, it was possible to </p>
<p>reduce the local signal to the point where it could then be dealt </p>
<p>with by more conventional methods.</p>
<p>Another difficulty lay in the necessity, or at least the </p>
<p>advisability, for compensating the diurnal phase shifts on the long </p>
<p>path from Wales to the State of Washington. It was obviously more </p>
<p>desirable to let the Jim Creek signal have a constant timing in </p>
<p>agreement with Criggion in an absolute sense, rather than to allow </p>
<p>it to follow the diurnal fluctuations of the signal from Criggion as </p>
<p>received at Jim Creek. This meant that corrections should be applied </p>
<p>to the observed Criggion phase to make it simulate a signal that </p>
<p>would have been observed if there were no diurnal variation in the </p>
<p>time of propagation. This problem had two parts: computation of the </p>
<p>phase changes to be expected, and design of a device that would </p>
<p>correct the observed phase by the expected amount.</p>
<p>The second part was achieved by building a mechanism that would </p>
<p>drive a phase shifter at one of two adjustable rates. This was </p>
<p>actuated by two alarm clocks that could be set to the minute, and </p>
<p>there was an adjustable limit to the rotation of the phase shifter. </p>
<p>At the predicted time of sunrise in Wales, the phase shifter would </p>
<p>start rotating at a selected rate, so that at the time of sunrise at </p>
<p>Jim Creek the phase of the local comparison signal would have </p>
<p>decreased by the expected amount, which was intended to exactly </p>
<p>balance the phase change in the incoming signal during the sunrise </p>
<p>interva At the time of sunset in Wales the reverse process would </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="creek">Equipment for Jim Creek</b> </a>266</p>
<p>begin, the only difference being in the rate of change established </p>
<p>by a second adjustable speed changer. This sunset variation would </p>
<p>continue until the original night-time phase level had been </p>
<p>restored. It was, of course, necessary to arrange for conditions, </p>
<p>mach as midsummer on the long east-west path, when there was no </p>
<p>complete night over the whole transmission path. Under these </p>
<p>circumstances, the diurnal correction pattern would be triangular, </p>
<p>rather than trapezoidal, and one of the stable levels would never be </p>
<p>reached.</p>
<p>It would be necessary to change the starting times, the rates, and </p>
<p>the total day-to-night variation each two or three days because of </p>
<p>the changing length of daylight. I did my best to pre-compute all of </p>
<p>these variables, and give Jim Creek a table of what all the settings </p>
<p>should be for various dates. Fortunately, with care and study these </p>
<p>calculations could be corrected, because a continuous record of the </p>
<p>observed phase track at Jim Creek would show the result of errors in </p>
<p>the assumptions by its departure from linearity. In principle, </p>
<p>therefore, the tables could gradually be made more exact.</p>
<p>I felt that one other complication ought to be built into the </p>
<p>equipment we made. It was clear that any navigation aid that </p>
<p>concentrated its service near the United States would have its best </p>
<p>accuracy in or near that area. It could therefore be more useful to </p>
<p>an enemy than would an equivalent system operated from his part of </p>
<p>the world. With a passive system, like Draco, any number of </p>
<p>navigators could use its service at the simple cost of building </p>
<p>appropriate receivers. The best defense I could think of to counter </p>
<p>this possible threat was to conceal the fact that such a system was </p>
<p>in operation.</p>
<p>To do this, at least for a time, we made a phase shifter that was </p>
<p>driven by a synchronous motor through change gears that permitted </p>
<p>selection of any of a large number of rates. These were adjusted so </p>
<p>that they could be varied in tiny steps up to a frequency difference </p>
<p>of about 3 parts in 10^8, or enough to guarantee an error of fifteen </p>
<p>or twenty miles an hour. One of these was used at the slave </p>
<p>transmitter and a similar device was used to provide a compensating </p>
<p>offset in the frequency of the oscillator used in each navigator's </p>
<p>receiver.</p>
<p>The total effect was as follows. After much effort a signal from </p>
<p>Criggion would be used to stabilize the frequency from which the Jim </p>
<p>Creek transmitting frequency would be derived. The transmitter </p>
<p>frequency would then be set off from the nominal frequency by an </p>
<p>amount that in ordinary terms was very small, but that corresponded </p>
<p>to a large error in the coherence of the two signals when considered </p>
<p>as an aid to navigation. At the navigator's receiver an opposite </p>
<p>offset would permit operation exactly as if the offsets did not </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="conceal">Concealment of the Draco System</b> </a>267</p>
<p>exist, because the frequency differences inserted were </p>
<p>mathematically exact. Any desired pre-planned code could be used to </p>
<p>schedule the frequency offsets. These might be changed a number of </p>
<p>times a day so that an untutored observer who intercompared the </p>
<p>signals would only discover that they seemed to be derived from </p>
<p>crystal oscillators that aged at independent rates, as all </p>
<p>oscillators did. An error, for example, could be arranged to </p>
<p>increase gradually and then be brought back suddenly, to simulate </p>
<p>the occasional correction of a frequency in terms of some standard.</p>
<p>For our experiment it was not necessary to use complex coding </p>
<p>tables. As I have described above, in this era there was a </p>
<p>considerable difference between the standard frequepoy signals of </p>
<p>Great Britain and American, as they were adjusted according to </p>
<p>differing philosophies. It was easy therefore to operate the </p>
<p>oscillator at Jim Creek in coherence with the Criggion signal, and </p>
<p>then set off the Jim Creek frequency by an amount that brought it </p>
<p>into approximate agreement with the American standard. It was not </p>
<p>necessary to do this with frequent changes, as the two standards </p>
<p>differed chiefly with the season of the year, and because no station </p>
<p>kept to its assigned frequency very exactly in those days.</p>
<p>When the equipment for all these things had been completed, it was </p>
<p>the summer of 1956. All of the gear, with measuring instruments, </p>
<p>spare oscillators and small parts, was loaded into a panel truck and </p>
<p>driven to Seattle by a pair of technicians, while I flew to San </p>
<p>Diego for a more or less routine meeting and thence to Seattle.</p>
<p>On arrival at Jim Creek we found that the Navy's permission for us </p>
<p>to work there must have been unusually wholehearted, for the first </p>
<p>activity was to show us the coffee mess and invite us to use it as </p>
<p>our own. The man in technical charge was the civilian chief </p>
<p>engineer, Lou Riley, who had been a Chief Petty Officer in the Navy </p>
<p>when sent there to help with the installation of the transmitter. </p>
<p>Lou loved the Cascades and presently retired from the Navy to come </p>
<p>back as civilian so that he could not be ordered to go anywhere </p>
<p>else. One of his favorite pastimes was taking groups of Boy Scouts </p>
<p>on camping trips in the mountains. He always kept fishing gear in </p>
<p>his car and usually stopped at every stream he passed to see if he </p>
<p>could quickly catch a trout. Lou was the heart and soul of the </p>
<p>station, and I used to wonder whether it could be kept in operation </p>
<p>without him. Later I heard that he was offered a corresponding </p>
<p>position at the really super-powered station at Cutler, Maine, but </p>
<p>he declined this plum so that he could stay in the Cascades.</p>
<p>The size of the station was a revelation to me. The antenna </p>
<p>consisted of ten copperweld cables 8,000 feet long strung across a </p>
<p>narrow valley between two ridges 3,000 feet high. The centers of </p>
<p>these strands were connected to downleads that were brought together </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concealment of the Draco System 268</p>
<p>into a sort of transmission line that carried them back to the </p>
<p>transmitter building. The antenna was actually separated into two </p>
<p>halves, each excited by its own transmitter, so that in case of </p>
<p>accident or the need for maintenance the station could operate at </p>
<p>half-power for a time. The transmitter building was a concrete box a </p>
<p>hundred feet or so square without windows and with access to the </p>
<p>area of the transmitter itself only by elevator from below. As </p>
<p>befitted a station with a transmitter whose component sections were </p>
<p>mostly of the order of cubes ten feet on a side, the elevator was so </p>
<p>big that we simply drove our truck into it for the ride up to the </p>
<p>operating level.</p>
<p>We spent two or three days setting up our equipment and erecting a </p>
<p>whip antenna for receiving the signal from Criggion. As the </p>
<p>transmitter building was the only possible site for our gear in the </p>
<p>immediate vicinity, the whip was installed on the roof about fifty </p>
<p>feet from the lead-in which carried about 700 amperes of radio-</p>
<p>frequency current. It was in setting up this antenna that we </p>
<p>discovered the falsity of the common statement that r.f. does not </p>
<p>shock; it simply produces surface burns. This may be the truth for </p>
<p>small quantities as high-frequency currents tend to flow only on the </p>
<p>surface of a conductor, but it fails by a wide margin to explain the </p>
<p>behavior of large currents at such a low frequency as Jim Creek's. </p>
<p>Our rough calibration of the field strength near the transmitter </p>
<p>lead-in was as follows: a bit of metal up to five or six inches long </p>
<p>(such as a screwdriver or a pair of pliers) stings like a nettle; </p>
<p>rubber gloves are a necessity for handling metal objects a foot or </p>
<p>two long; and touching a conductor five or six feet long can knock </p>
<p>one down.</p>
<p>The minor pain we encountered in setting up this antenna was wasted, </p>
<p>as we never detected a signal from Criggion at that site. Two or </p>
<p>three days passed while we searched for the signal. This was a slow </p>
<p>process as the only indication of its presence would be the tracking </p>
<p>behavior of our servos over a half-hour or more. The search was </p>
<p>complicated by the fact that our oscillators had completely lost </p>
<p>calibration in the trip across the country, while the signal from </p>
<p>WWV which we had expected to use to find the correct frequency was </p>
<p>received so poorly as to be essentially useless. At that date, the </p>
<p>only real access to precise frequency was through the signals </p>
<p>transmitted for the purpose by WWV from near Washington, D.C., and </p>
<p>also from WWVH in Hawaii. Neither of these signals was received well </p>
<p>enough for the very accurate calibration we had to make. It </p>
<p>therefore was a painful and erratic search, moving our oscillator in </p>
<p>small steps through what we hoped was an adequate frequency range, </p>
<p>and watching the servo record for symptoms of proper tracking. </p>
<p>Frequently random behavior would look real for a few minutes and </p>
<p>lead us to erroneous corrections because our patience was under such </p>
<p>strain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="criggion">Trying to Find the Criggion Signal</b> </a>269</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end we gave up trying to operate at the transmitter site. In </p>
<p>the search for an alternate we found that there was a little </p>
<p>microwave hut at the top of one of the mountains that supported the </p>
<p>large antenna. This hut received signals, from Seattle I suppose, </p>
<p>and relayed them down to the station in a telephone cable. The hut </p>
<p>was not much more than a mile in a direct line from the transmitter, </p>
<p>but was reached by seven miles of mountain road. The hut was near </p>
<p>the southwestern-most stub tower that supported one of the strands </p>
<p>of the big antenna. This tower was about 200 feet high and made an </p>
<p>ideal point to which to tie a fairly long wire receiving antenna. At </p>
<p>this site we set up our gear in an odd corner and, without too much </p>
<p>difficulty, detected the Criggion signal. Without any proof, I still </p>
<p>believe that our failure down below was due to the weakness of the </p>
<p>Criggion signal at the bottom of the narrow valley the signal was </p>
<p>none too strong at the top of the mountain. We estimated the one </p>
<p>microvolt per meter that I mentioned above from the degree of </p>
<p>sluggishness of our servos. In other words, if the signal had been </p>
<p>stronger the tracking would have been faster or better.</p>
<p>At this stage, excitement took over. We had, at the top of the </p>
<p>mountain, a frequency equal to that assigned to Jim Creek and locked </p>
<p>to the British standard of frequency with a precision of about a </p>
<p>part in ten billion. Down in the valley was the station operating at </p>
<p>the same frequency but perhaps in error by a part in ten thousand. </p>
<p>And between the two was a telephone cable with pairs to spare. With </p>
<p>only a quick look with an oscilloscope to see that the local signal </p>
<p>accidentally induced in the cable was not too formidable, and not </p>
<p>waiting to provide proper balancing and segregation for our circuit, </p>
<p>we connected our output to the line and telephoned down to Lou to </p>
<p>try our new signal source on the transmitter. To our delight, it </p>
<p>took over the frequency control without a quiver, although a </p>
<p>terrible oscillation might have ensued with a megawatt of power </p>
<p>trying to feed back into our telephone line. The Criggion-Jim Creek </p>
<p>Draco pair was instantly in full operation.</p>
<p>Within a day or two the people in Cambridge reported that the </p>
<p>stabilized pair was operating about as expected. Little was left to </p>
<p>do except to continue operation for a while to assure ourselves that </p>
<p>the long-term statistics were reasonably satisfactory.</p>
<p>Like all high-powered stations, Jim Creek had elaborate arrange </p>
<p>ments for shutting down the transmitter quickly, in case of </p>
<p>accidents of various kinds. A part of these precautions is spoken of </p>
<p>as dumping, because as the high-voltage power supply is shut off the </p>
<p>large capacitors that smooth the rectified voltages are short-</p>
<p>circuited by heavy bars as a precaution against melting down of </p>
<p>components or possible electrocution of personnel. Such a dump is </p>
<p>momentarily violent, as tremendous voltages and currents are </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="dracolives">Draco Lives!</b> </a>270</p>
<p>suddenly discharged, and there is often a considerable reaction on </p>
<p>the power supply for the station. I had the misfortune to be, I </p>
<p>suppose, perhaps the only person who ever dumped a super-power </p>
<p>transmitter by tripping over an extension cord and pulling it out of </p>
<p>a 120-volt wall outlet. This statement is amusing but not quite </p>
<p>accurate. When I stumbled over the power cord for our equipment in </p>
<p>the microwave hut, the transmitter simply fell dead for a moment. </p>
<p>Without stopping to think, I plugged the cord in again and the </p>
<p>transient in our own equipment activated the safety mechanisms and </p>
<p>produced the dump. I realized what I had done as the lights failed </p>
<p>momentarily, but by then it was too late for anything but apologies. </p>
<p>Fortunately, no one belonging, to the station made any appreciable </p>
<p>fuss over this incident, but my face was very red when next we went </p>
<p>down to the transmitter building.</p>
<p>At about this time the Navy's frequency monitoring station in San </p>
<p>Francisco sent Jim Creek a notice that it was two or three cycles </p>
<p>off from its assigned frequency. Actually the station had never </p>
<p>since its construction been so accurately controlled. In fact, it </p>
<p>must have been, at this date, except for WWV, the American station </p>
<p>with the highest frequency stability ever known. We spent a little </p>
<p>time in checking that everything was operating correctly, and even </p>
<p>more time in trying to decide how to explain the situation in a </p>
<p>message to San Francisco. Before this problem could be solved, a </p>
<p>second message arrived from the monitoring station admitting that </p>
<p>the first one had been sent in error. Lou Riley relieved his </p>
<p>feelings and delighted me by sending back a message saying, "The </p>
<p>next time you think our frequency is wrong, don't call us call WWV!"</p>
<p>Fortunately we had almost finished our extensive work at the top of </p>
<p>the mountain before we learned the whole story about the habits of </p>
<p>the trucks loaded with big logs that often passed through the </p>
<p>station grounds. It appeared that the Navy owned a piece of property </p>
<p>several miles square, which indeed it required, and was having a </p>
<p>commercial company cut the timber on a part of the area. The trees </p>
<p>were good-sized Douglas firs, and we were used to seeing trucks </p>
<p>heavily loaded with three or four logs each several feet in </p>
<p>diameter. We learned that the trucks were equipped with large </p>
<p>reservoirs so that water could be poured over the brake drums to </p>
<p>take away the heat developed in them on downward trips. In the </p>
<p>lumbermen's forests, the trails were cut at a pitch steep enough to </p>
<p>make it possible that a truck could not be stopped on the way down, </p>
<p>although it could usually be kept under sufficient control to stay </p>
<p>in the road. In the Naval station, the main road up the mountain had </p>
<p>been one of these truck trails. Although it had been paved and </p>
<p>widened a little, it was still not a highway in which one would wish </p>
<p>to pass a big truck, and we were fortunate in never having this </p>
<p>experience as we went up and down the mountain. The factor that </p>
<p>would have frightened us badly, had we known it sooner, was a high </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="logging">Logging Roads / Security</b> </a>271</p>
<p>degree of ambiguity. In the forests, the truck drivers followed a </p>
<p>simple rule: on meeting a car, the truck would take the side of the </p>
<p>road next the mountain; if any space was left on the side of the </p>
<p>precipice, the other vehicle was welcome to it.</p>
<p>In the Naval station, on the other hand, the rule was to keep to the </p>
<p>right under all circumstances. After learning of this uncertainty, </p>
<p>we never approached a blind corner without wondering whether it </p>
<p>concealed a big truck, and, if so, which rule it would follow.</p>
<p>We were told that when a loaded truck went off the road winches and </p>
<p>cables were brought to the site and the logs were carefully dragged </p>
<p>back up to the road. After such a fall, the truck was ruined, but </p>
<p>the logs were still worth several thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>* * ** </p>
<p>After this trip I had no further written communication with Jim </p>
<p>Creek. The commander of the Naval Station at Seattle was obsessed by </p>
<p>fear that communists were watching his every move. He instructed me, </p>
<p>on my duty call, that I was to have no communication with Jim Creek </p>
<p>until he had set up a security system that would make it safe. In my </p>
<p>view, nothing was required. I was deeply concerned about security </p>
<p>and was never likely to speak carelessly or without adequate </p>
<p>camouflage. As it happened, Leo the Lion, the commander in question, </p>
<p>never did anything further in the matter. I therefore kept my </p>
<p>communications to a minimum, chiefly in the form of answering phone </p>
<p>calls from Lou when he needed a little technical advice. I have </p>
<p>therefore very little written evidence of this whole experimental </p>
<p>program.</p>
<p>We continued to observe the stabilized signals for a year or more. </p>
<p>The results were generally satisfactory with errors not often larger </p>
<p>than a mile or two in the line of position through Cambridge. We </p>
<p>gradually improved the prediction methods that were required for the </p>
<p>production of charts and tables. In the meantime, the Navy had </p>
<p>contracted with Pickard and Burns, the company that Dick Woodward </p>
<p>had joined, to produce two sets of synchronizing equipment for </p>
<p>transmitting stations and a few receivers for testing purposes. </p>
<p>These instruments were built with much more professional finish than </p>
<p>our experimental gear, but I doubt that they could have worked </p>
<p>better. One set of transmitter equipment was used to replace ours at </p>
<p>Jim Creek (although that station kept our gear there for several </p>
<p>years for standby and checking purposes) and a second set was </p>
<p>installed at a naval station at Annapolis, Maryland, after GBR had </p>
<p>resumed operation at Rugby, England. This was a convenient but </p>
<p>perhaps unfortunate choice because, as seen from Annapolis, the </p>
<p>directions to the Rugby-Jim Creek pair of stations subtended less </p>
<p>than 120 degrees. It followed that (neglecting a few hundred miles </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="observations">Draco Observations</b> </a>272</p>
<p>near Annapolis, within which distance propagationial behavior might </p>
<p>be uncertain) the triplet of stations could be expected to give </p>
<p>magnificent service in Hudson's Bay and the Arctic Ocean. On the </p>
<p>other hand, operation south of Annapolis would be characterized, </p>
<p>because of unfavorable geometrical factors, by large errors in </p>
<p>latitude. The measurements would be good in longitude because in </p>
<p>that coordinate the result would depend almost entirely upon the </p>
<p>long pair, between Rugby and Jim Creek. The Navy had, of course, no </p>
<p>intention of experimenting with Draco in the arctic. From this time </p>
<p>onward, tests were carried out entirely within the Navy, although </p>
<p>outlines of most, if not all, of the data were sent to me for my own </p>
<p>interpretation.</p>
<p>At the time of these experiments, the Navy operated a vessel, the </p>
<p>Compass Island, entirely for the testing of various aids, to </p>
<p>navigation. She carried many conventional navigation devices, </p>
<p>including the inertial, and also had a computer room which attempted </p>
<p>to deduce the most probable position at all times, and to assign </p>
<p>apparent errors to the devices under test. The ship made two trips </p>
<p>for which the data were of interest to me. On the first, she </p>
<p>proceeded south from New York to a point near the Bahamas and then </p>
<p>made a series of runs east and west at separations of two or three </p>
<p>miles, followed by a similar series north and south. I never heard </p>
<p>what the purpose of these runs may have been, but they provided an </p>
<p>ideal testing pattern as the ship spent quite a lot of time moving </p>
<p>in an area about forty miles square.</p>
<p>On the passage south, the Compass Island passed a point where </p>
<p>Annapolis and Jim Creek had the same bearing from the ship. Because </p>
<p>of this, and because of the short distance from Annapolis, no useful </p>
<p>information could be had except from the long pair. Happily, this </p>
<p>part of the course was within a few miles or being exactly south. I </p>
<p>therefore assumed the ship's reported latitude to be correct and </p>
<p>solved the observed readings for longitude only. These points, for </p>
<p>two and a half days, could conveniently be plotted in a single </p>
<p>diagram that showed not more than one or two points in a hundred to </p>
<p>be more than a mile east or west of the ship's reported position.</p>
<p>Near the Bahamas, it was possible to use both pairs but, as said </p>
<p>above, with much larger errors In the north-south direction. As a </p>
<p>result the east-west runs looked terrible on my graph, as the random </p>
<p>variations made the tracks fluctuate so much that they frequently </p>
<p>overlapped for a few miles. Conversely, the north-south runs looked </p>
<p>beautiful on my map as the east-west scatter was quite small. When I </p>
<p>took the trouble to plot the errors of Draco in their distance and </p>
<p>direction from the center of a diagram there was, of course, no </p>
<p>noticeable difference between the diagrams for the two sets of runs. </p>
<p>In both cases the probable ellipses that included almost all of the </p>
<p>observed points showed maximum errors of a little less than a mile </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="results">More Draco Results</b> </a>273</p>
<p>in longitude but errors four times larger in latitude. At least, the </p>
<p>shape and orientation of the ellipses agreed with the theory, </p>
<p>indicating that with suitably located stations the standard </p>
<p>deviation of a fix should be only about a nautical mile.</p>
<p>The other passage that interested me was when the Compass Island </p>
<p>came through the western end of the Mediterranean Sea and across the </p>
<p>Atlantic Ocean. In this case, the position determined by Draco after </p>
<p>the ship left the Gates of Hercules diverged more and more from the </p>
<p>supposed position for many hour; until suddenly the computer room </p>
<p>report moved sideways about fifteen miles in a fifteen minute </p>
<p>interval and came to rest within a mile of the Draco position. There </p>
<p>was nothing included with the data that gave a clue to explain why </p>
<p>this happened. I therefore wrote the ship's navigating officer to </p>
<p>ask if he could explain this peculiarity. After searching the </p>
<p>records he produced an answer. At the time of the sudden anomaly, </p>
<p>the ship had come within sight of Madeira!</p>
<p>In the neighborhood of Bermuda there was another instance when, to </p>
<p>my prejudiced eye, Draco seemed to have performed more consistently </p>
<p>than had whatever the Compass Island used for its primary </p>
<p>navigational information. I cannot cite this so exactly, as the </p>
<p>evidence was less clear and, to tell the truth, I have forgotten the </p>
<p>precise details. Because all of this effort was under military </p>
<p>security classification, I no longer have any of the documents in </p>
<p>the case.</p>
<p>As a result of these experiments, there was some small Naval </p>
<p>interest in Draco. Unfortunately, however, the only serious office </p>
<p>was the one planning navigational methods for the Polaris </p>
<p>submarines. Their interest was little less than silly because, as </p>
<p>explained above, Draco could tell nothing unless the tracking was </p>
<p>continuous. Although signals at the Draco frequencies could be </p>
<p>received to some small depth under water, it was impossible to hear </p>
<p>them at the depths where the submarines would wish to spend most of </p>
<p>their time. This meant that when the submarine was not near the </p>
<p>surface it would be necessary to switch to artificial signals from a </p>
<p>stable oscillator and advance the position by dead reckoning in </p>
<p>terms of the ship's heading and speed (both of which were quite </p>
<p>accurately known in the Polaris vessels) so that the real signal </p>
<p>would be found near the estimated phase when the submarine again </p>
<p>came near the surface. The Polaris ships were to have good </p>
<p>oscillators and computers that could carry out this procedure, but </p>
<p>there was (or should have been) grave doubt about how long such a </p>
<p>period without signals could be.</p>
<p>There was an interval when the new Polaris submarines had space </p>
<p>reserved for a Draco receiver, but elementary common sense </p>
<p>ultimately prevailed and the idea was finally abandoned. During the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More Draco Results 274</p>
<p>period of uncertainty I was to be found in the curious position of </p>
<p>arguing against the use of my own idea but on this subject there is </p>
<p>no evidence that the Navy paid any attention to me.</p>
<p>The Draco technique came to life again about 1970. By that time, the </p>
<p>U. S. Navy had installed cesium-controlled oscillators in all of its </p>
<p>very-low-frequency stations, so that they transmitted what were in </p>
<p>effect standard ftequencies. These are now very exact and are </p>
<p>monitored by the Naval Observatory and occasionally corrected when </p>
<p>necessary. These stations and a few in other countries now provide </p>
<p>the kind of service we had between Criggion and Jim Creek, without </p>
<p>the need for any special equipment in the transmitting stations. </p>
<p>There is, of course, no attempt at concealment and this service is </p>
<p>useful to anyone.</p>
<p>This new form of Draco, usually called simply lip navigation, has </p>
<p>been promoted energetically by the Global Navigation Company of </p>
<p>California. Receivers are relatively inexpensive and are favored by </p>
<p>the owners of small aircraft as the method gives very fine results </p>
<p>for flight durations of only a few hours, during which diurnal </p>
<p>variations in propagation need not be compensated. Some </p>
<p>manufacturers are now offering this same lip service as an adjunct </p>
<p>to automatic Omega receivers, but this subject brings me too far </p>
<p>ahead of my story.</p>

<b><p><a name="hatters">Non-Professional Matters</a></p>
</b><p>In 1958, Catherine and I decided that the children, then 13 and 11, </p>
<p>were old enough to benefit from an automobile trip as far west as </p>
<p>Colorado and Montana. In August I had a meeting at Boulder, so we </p>
<p>spent three or four weeks getting there and back. We started with </p>
<p>visits to Catherine's kin in New York State and then made calls on </p>
<p>my elder daughter, Marty, and her husband who was a young teacher of </p>
<p>poetry at Antioch College. They had collaborated in the production </p>
<p>of my first two grand-daughters in the last four years. This visit </p>
<p>was somewhat painful as I had felt (and still feel) that I should </p>
<p>stay out of Marty's life for her own peace of mind, as her </p>
<p>sympathies after the divorce could only have been with her mother. </p>
<p>We had actually only met the young people once or twice when they </p>
<p>had called in Arlington on their way to visit friends in Maine.</p>
<p>When Ohio was behind us, we went westward with tourist stops to </p>
<p>examine Lincoln memorabilia in Springfield, Illinois, and those of </p>
<p>Mark Twain in Hannibal, Missouri. The season and the temperature </p>
<p>made it advisable to do a good bit of traveling at early hours in </p>
<p>the morning. I still recall my pride, one day in Kansas, at getting </p>
<p>Catherine up early enough to put 175 miles behind us before stopping </p>
<p>for breakfast.</p>
<p>I cannot remember what Catherine and the children must have done </p>
<p>while I was busy with my meetings. The clearest recollection in </p>
<p>Boulder is of the difficulty in getting the children to eat anywhere </p>
<p>except at Fred's Columbine Cafe. The attraction in this </p>
<p>establishment was a Monsterburger, consisting of a pound or so of </p>
<p>excellent beef in a sandwich made from a six-inch section of a large </p>
<p>loaf of French bread. In those days the children's father had no </p>
<p>difficulty in demolishing his own monsterburger, hard as that is to </p>
<p>understand thirty years later.</p>
<p>From Boulder we drove north and west through Colorado and Wyoming. </p>
<p>We stopped chiefly to buy western hats for the children in Laramie, </p>
<p>and to get a fossil fish as a souvenir at a lonely shop run by a man </p>
<p>who enjoyed asking tourists to guess where he came from, as he was a </p>
<p>transplanted Eskimo. We searched for and located Sacajawea's grave </p>
<p>in a very interesting cemetery in the Shoshone reservation at Wind </p>
<p>River, Wyoming, where many of the markers were actually the white </p>
<p>headboards of enamelled iron beds. We intended to spend only a night </p>
<p>in the Jackson Lake Lodge, but found it so attractive and convenient </p>
<p>that we stayed there several days and commuted daily to Yellowstone </p>
<p>Park. There we believe we saw everything there was to see from Old </p>
<p>Faithful to the smallest mud-pot, and from the bears and elks to the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="western">Western Trip</b> </a>276</p>
<p>chipmunks. We also started a long family difference of opinion. </p>
<p>Catherine firmly believes that the famous pond on the continental </p>
<p>divide really does have two outlets, one to the Pacific Ocean and </p>
<p>one to the Gulf of Mexico. I, on the other hand, noticed that there </p>
<p>were distinct indications of shovel work apparently intended to keep </p>
<p>one end of the pond open. Also, I have seen so much evidence of the </p>
<p>power of water to carve out its preferred channel that it is hard to </p>
<p>believe in a pond that can not decide in which direction to find its </p>
<p>outlet.</p>
<p>After finally leaving the Park in a northerly direction, we saw a </p>
<p>large bird sitting in the road ahead of us. To our astonishment, </p>
<p>when the car came close enough to scare the bird into flight, it </p>
<p>turned out to be a pelican. We had all felt that the pelican </p>
<p>occurred only in Florida and similar clime; so that it was only </p>
<p>after we got home that we found that actually pelicans have a fresh </p>
<p>water breeding range which includes the Yellowstone River.</p>
<p>In Montana we located the home of a friend of Catherine who had </p>
<p>married a rancher and now helped conduct a riding camp for boys. </p>
<p>After we had investigated the house and nearby buildings, as nothing </p>
<p>was locked, we deduced that they were all out on a ride and had </p>
<p>moved along. After we had turned toward home we stopped to examine </p>
<p>the Fort Peck dam, which was then finished, although the lake it was </p>
<p>supposed to form was not yet filled. My current atlas shows a lake </p>
<p>now almost a hundred miles long and probably averaging six or eight </p>
<p>miles wide. Judging by the height of the earthen dam we saw, the </p>
<p>lake must also be fairly deep. The Missouri River is surely no </p>
<p>longer, what it once must have been.</p>
<p>After a call on some of Catherine's Taylor cousins in northern </p>
<p>Wisconsin, we went around the upper end of Lake Michigan and were </p>
<p>astonished to find more neon lights in St. Ignace than either of us </p>
<p>remembered seeing in Times Square. We also found it almost </p>
<p>impossible to find lodging in a place so full of summer visitors. We </p>
<p>crossed the beautiful bridge at the Straits of Mackinac and drove </p>
<p>directly to Port Huron and crossed into the Province of Ontario.</p>
<p>In Brantford we had two surprises. One was a small museum dedicated </p>
<p>to Alexander Graham Bell, Brantford in some way claimed that that </p>
<p>was where the telephone had been invented. The evidence, </p>
<p>inconclusive to us, was in the form of a letter or two that could be </p>
<p>construed to suggest that the idea might have come to Bell while he </p>
<p>was visiting there. In any case, the excuse was sufficient to have </p>
<p>brought together a good collection of early telephone equipment, </p>
<p>which was of interest to me, at least.</p>
<p>The second surprise began a considerable modification of our ideas </p>
<p>of the history of the American Revolution in New York State. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Western Trip 277</p>
<p>Catherine grew up only a few miles west of the Unadilla River which </p>
<p>was, until after the Revolution, the boundary between the settlers </p>
<p>and the Indians. We were therefore used to seeing small monuments </p>
<p>marking the sites of farms and hamlets destroyed by Joseph Brant, </p>
<p>who was a chief of the Mohawks and is still recalled locally as a </p>
<p>fiend incarnate. In Brantford we discovered that Joseph was a </p>
<p>loyalist hero of the revolutionary period and actually a full </p>
<p>colonel in the British army. Later reading disclosed that he had </p>
<p>been a student at Eleaser Wheelock's school at Lebanon, Connecticut, </p>
<p>before it was moved to Dartmouth, New Hampshire. Joseph Brant had </p>
<p>been presented at Court in London, had become a companion of Boswell </p>
<p>and of the Prince of Wales, and had had his portrait painted by </p>
<p>Romney. In later years he fought courageously but. unsuccessfully to </p>
<p>unite all the Indian tribes as the only hope for stopping the white </p>
<p>advance into the middle west. The fiend incarnate had indeed another </p>
<p>side to his character, as is fittingly commemorated in the name of </p>
<p>the city and county in Ontario. </p>
<p>After our only extended visit to Niagara Falls we stopped in Geneva </p>
<p>and ended eur trip in Brookfield. In 1985 it is interesting to note </p>
<p>that on our eight thousand mile trip it cost an average of less than </p>
<p>ten dollars a night for motels for the four of us; and operating </p>
<p>costs for the car (including some repairs) were almost precisely </p>
<p>three cents a mile. Throughout the trip it had seemed to us that the </p>
<p>children had paid little attention to anything outside the car. I </p>
<p>suppose that this must be a common illusion, as later remarks </p>
<p>indicate that they did notice and remember quite a surprising </p>
<p>amount.</p>
<p>I recall two moderately amusing incidents. While we did find </p>
<p>tumbleweed tumbling on schedule as we crossed from Kansas into </p>
<p>Colorado, we had to wait a long time before seeing any cowboys in </p>
<p>action. When we finally did, it violated all tradition. In a </p>
<p>reservation somewhere we watched a number of mounted cowboys herding </p>
<p>cattle toward and into cattle cars but the Cowboys were Indians!</p>
<p>A device we had adopted to help keep the children quiet was to give </p>
<p>each of them a sketchbook and pencils. At some point in the trip Joy </p>
<p>announced that she was about to draw a picture of me, and I </p>
<p>instructed her to be sure to capture my bold, hawklike expression. </p>
<p>She worked quietly for some time in the rear seat of the car and </p>
<p>produced a creditable picture of the back of my head with, I hope, a </p>
<p>somewhat exaggerated representation of my thinning hair. There was </p>
<p>even a faint observable influence of my instructions; she had </p>
<p>entitled the sketch the Bald Eagle.</p>

<p>This anecdote reminds me that, although it may violate chronological </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Western Trips / Anecdotes 278</p>
<p>sequence, I must not forget an incident soon after Bob had begun to </p>
<p>study Latin and Joy French. We were in Brookfield where the children </p>
<p>bad rooms in opposite ends of the house. For some reason I do not </p>
<p>remember, Catherine had had to be much more severe than was </p>
<p>customary in expressing disapproval of some prank they had both </p>
<p>engaged in. The kids then retired into a huddle with cardboard and </p>
<p>colored paints for an hour or more. When we discovered the results </p>
<p>there were two handsomely drawn and decorated signs. The door to </p>
<p>Joy's room bore the label Chez Chien, and Bob's door was marked, </p>
<p>Domus Canis.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>When Bob was two years old his speech was at times indistinct, but </p>
<p>one phrase he had mastered was horse hide robe. This came about </p>
<p>because we still have a number of such carriage robes that on </p>
<p>Catherine's grandfather's farm were always made up whenever a </p>
<p>favorite horse had to be destroyed. Bob enjoyed feeling their </p>
<p>texture and practiced the name again and again. Unfortunately, this </p>
<p>happened at Christmas time, when Al and his wife came to call, </p>
<p>largely, I fancy, to let Anne show off her new mink coat. Bob </p>
<p>toddled across the room to Anne and stroked the fur happily while </p>
<p>clearly pronouncing his new phrase. I suspect that Anne had seldom </p>
<p>been so shocked nor Catherine so embarrassed.</p>

<b><p>Catherine</p>
</b><p>All in all, I believe I am entitled to be dissatisfied with the </p>
<p>performance of the medical world in Catherine's case. I am still, at </p>
<p>the end of January, receiving reports of payments of medical, </p>
<p>insurance. These have considerably exceeded $30,000, with payments </p>
<p>to a dozen or two of consultants, or analysts of innumerable tests. </p>
<p>So far as I can tell, nothing useful was ever done for Catherine </p>
<p>except to feed her through one kind of tube or another and, no </p>
<p>doubt, to wash her from time to time. Her long hair, certainly, was </p>
<p>never washed or brushed out enough to remove the cement-like </p>
<p>substance left from the brain-wave measurements. It was never easy </p>
<p>to get any information from anyone, and I saw no evidence of </p>
<p>sympathy except from a small minority of the nurses. I have </p>
<p>instructed my children never, under any circumstances, to let me be </p>
<p>taken to the second of the hospitals that cared for Catherine.</p>
<p>We buried Catherine in Brookfield, as we had long planned, and where </p>
<p>I trust that I may join her presently; preferably after I get these </p>
<p>memoirs finished. In Arlington, we contented ourselves with a </p>
<p>memorial service, and I was especially happy to have eight people </p>
<p>from our old World War II group come to it. I was also much pleased </p>
<p>by one detail. The minister knew about her claim that she read </p>
<p>Ivanhoe annually, and I had told him about my reading to her just </p>
<p>before she died. The death of one of our very favorite authors, H. </p>
<p>B. White, had been reported the day before the service. This gave </p>
<p>the minister the opportumity for a very graceful reference to his </p>
<p>mental picture of Catherine, with a copy of Ivanhoe and of one of </p>
<p>John Gould's books under her arm, waiting to greet E. B. White when </p>
<p>he arrived.</p>

<b><p>A trip to England</p>
</b><p>In the autumn of 1957 my ideas about using very low radio </p>
<p>frequencies for an aid to navigation were beginning to be </p>
<p>circulated. Somehow a rumor of this must have reached the Royal </p>
<p>Navy, for the U. S. Navy began to ask me to go to England to confer </p>
<p>with the Admiralty Signals Establishment at Portsmouth. I arranged </p>
<p>the trip to include visits to some places where I myself wished to </p>
<p>go. These included, of course, the National Physical Laboratory at </p>
<p>Teddington to see Dr. Essen; the Radio Research Board's experimental </p>
<p>station at Slough; the Royal Air Force station at Farnborough, with </p>
<p>which we were to have some collaboration five or ten years later; </p>
<p>the experimental station of the Marconi Company in London; and, </p>
<p>naturally, two or three offices in or near Whitehall. As I had been </p>
<p>in England in November, I should have known enough to postpone the </p>
<p>trip, but I did have a pleasant and interesting time in spite of the </p>
<p>usual early winter weather.</p>
<p>At that date most of the American ideas about improved navigational </p>
<p>aids were supposed to be classified. I tried in every way I could </p>
<p>conceive, both in person and by telephone, to get some guidance </p>
<p>about what I should tell the British, with no success whatever. I </p>
<p>was thus forced to utilize my own judgment and did, in fact, tell </p>
<p>one or two groups quite a little.</p>
<p>I think I spent about three weeks in England, with the accom </p>
<p>paniment of the standard winter cold in the head, but in this case </p>
<p>at least without influenza. The trip started with a fine example of </p>
<p>military delay. In that period workers under military contracts were </p>
<p>supposed to fly in Air Force transport planes. I was told to report </p>
<p>to an airfield in the wilds of New Jersey at 10 A.M. By rising early </p>
<p>I caught a plane to Newark and then found a bus connection to the </p>
<p>airport that got me there at the appointed time. Then I waited. The </p>
<p>aircraft was finally ready in the late afternoon and I had the </p>
<p>memorable experience of flying directly over our home at 6:30 in the </p>
<p>evening, about thirteen hours after I had left it. I saw a little of </p>
<p>Gander, Newfoundland, in the middle of the night and was dumped out </p>
<p>somewhere in the Midlands in the morning. From then on, fortunately, </p>
<p>I was able to use the excellent British trains and busses and could </p>
<p>schedule my arrivals better.</p>
<p>The Office of Naval Research branch in London found me a modest </p>
<p>hotel somewhere in Earls' Gate, which didn't look to me as if it had </p>
<p>ever seen an Earl. The details of my various visits are no longer </p>
<p>clear to me, partly because the activities are mixed up in my mind </p>
<p>with things that happened on other trips, and are not very exciting </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>281</p>
<p>anyway. I remember that I gave relatively formal lectures two or </p>
<p>three times. In London I enjoyed a dinner with the Council of the </p>
<p>Institute of Navigation, which did not achieve the adjective Royal </p>
<p>until later. The meal was strictly masculine and largely </p>
<p>characterized by the telling of smutty jokes, a field in which I did </p>
<p>not distinguish myself.</p>
<p>After a session at the Admiralty Signals Establishment, an </p>
<p>acquaintance took me a few miles east of Portsmouth for a drink at a </p>
<p>pub that delighted me as it had a fireplace bounded by two pillars </p>
<p>that had been found in a local Roman ruin. We went on to have dinner </p>
<p>in another town that I fancy may have been Bognor Regis. After the </p>
<p>meal I was taken to see a remarkable sight. There was a sort of man-</p>
<p>made bay on the waterfront, bounded by a long pier with what was </p>
<p>possibly a dance hall at the further end, with some corresponding </p>
<p>structure at the other side of the small bay. The few acres between </p>
<p>were illuminated by stray light from many neon signs and covered </p>
<p>with what seemed to be thousands of swans. There must have been </p>
<p>quite an admixture of red in the lights as the swans seemed to be a </p>
<p>lovely shade of shell pink. They were so tightly packed that they </p>
<p>apparently had little room in which to swim, yet they did move </p>
<p>continuously but slowly, rather like pairs of dancers on a crowded </p>
<p>floor. I was told that most of the swans in England come (or came) </p>
<p>to this little bay to spend the winter, but I have read since that </p>
<p>many English swans winter in other parts of Europe. Whatever the </p>
<p>case, there were many more swans than I have ever seen before or </p>
<p>since, even in total, and they made a most beautiful and </p>
<p>unforgettable sight in the winter night.</p>
<p>There were two other memorable incidents in Portsmouth. One was a </p>
<p>visit to HMS Victory. This was perhaps unusually thorough, being </p>
<p>made under a naval escort. I admired the old ship and gazed politely </p>
<p>at the inset plaque marking the spot on the deck where Nelson fell, </p>
<p>but I did not greatly care for the waxwork group below decks that </p>
<p>showed Captain Hardy holding Nelson in his arms as the Admiral died. </p>
<p>I thought that I would much rather have encountered this tableau at </p>
<p>Madame Tussaud's. The Victory is far larger than our Old Ironsides, </p>
<p>and also older, but I thought that having her bedded in concrete </p>
<p>took a little of the fun out of the experience.</p>
<p>The other happening was much more amusing. Just before teatime one </p>
<p>day I was escorted almost ceremoniously to the men's room and prac </p>
<p>tically bowed into the urinal used by General Eisenhower on D-Day </p>
<p>morning. The story is that after listening to all the arguments pro </p>
<p>and con about the weather on that day, the general went to this room </p>
<p>and used the fixture while making up his mind. He is reported to </p>
<p>have come back to the conference room and said no more than We go. I </p>
<p>gathered that I was supposed to feel flattered to have been allowed </p>
<p>to use the same plumbing.</p>

<p>My lecture at Slough was relatively stuffy and formal, perhaps </p>
<p>because my audience did not entirely believe what I was trying to </p>
<p>tell them about the remarkable stability of very low frequency radio </p>
<p>wave propagation. I do not recall that I greatly enjoyed myself </p>
<p>there although my treatment was certainly correct, although not </p>
<p>effusive.</p>
<p>My old acquaintance from 1936, Mr. J. A. Ratcliff, was then at the </p>
<p>famous Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, which is in </p>
<p>some way associated with Sidney Sussex College. I had the pleasure </p>
<p>of spending the night there in a very cold suite of rooms, but with </p>
<p>elegant attention from a scout (or is that what the college servant </p>
<p>is called at Oxford?). This visit included my only experience in </p>
<p>dining in Hall. After a very long preparation over drinks in the </p>
<p>Fellows' Common Room, the Dons and I marched in to surround the High </p>
<p>Table and found the undergraduates standing awaiting our arrival, </p>
<p>and also the most swift recitation of a Latin grace I ever heard. </p>
<p>Possibly as a courtesy, I found myself having to converse almost </p>
<p>entirely with the Master who, it seemed, was a classical scholar </p>
<p>with no interest at all in anything I knew much about. After a long </p>
<p>session over the port and a more general conversation over more </p>
<p>drinks back in the Commons, I was finally allowed to return to my </p>
<p>cold quarters and get, myself to bed as rapidly as possible. The </p>
<p>dinner, however, had been extremely good and, I thought, far </p>
<p>superior to what was served to the undergraduates, who were allowed </p>
<p>to retire long before the Dons finished.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>I had a very pleasant time when I visited the Marconi Company, with </p>
<p>which the old gentleman who gave me such a hard time in discussion </p>
<p>of my speech about Loran in 1945 had long keen connected. The Soviet </p>
<p>Sputnik had gone up just a month before my visit, and I found the </p>
<p>Marconi people doing a splendid job of recording the changes caused </p>
<p>by the doppler effect on the frequency of the radio signals received </p>
<p>from that first artificial satellite. The frequency at each passage </p>
<p>was automatically plotted as a long curve, ranging downward from </p>
<p>near an upper asymptote as the sputnik approached London to near a </p>
<p>lower asymptote after the satellite had passed beyond the receiver. </p>
<p>The curve was plotted by very clever instrumentation with an </p>
<p>accuracy that surprised me, and excellent deductions were already </p>
<p>being made. The plotted curve was almost perfectly anti-symmetrical. </p>
<p>The frequency difference between the asymptotes gave an excellent </p>
<p>measure of the speed of the satellite. The steepness of the curve at </p>
<p>its center of symmetry was reciprocally related to the distance from </p>
<p>the receiver to the satellite at the point where the orbit was </p>
<p>closest to London. After a few passes, which were of course at quite </p>
<p>different distances, these data had been reduced to an excellent </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="tracking">Tracking the First Satellite</b> </a>283</p>
<p>determination of the orbit. The degradation of the orbit as time </p>
<p>passed was already being measured and conclusions were being drawn </p>
<p>about the density and temperature of the atmosphere at the orbital </p>
<p>height. That all of this was being done so soon after the sputnik </p>
<p>had been sent up, and was being done so accurately without any </p>
<p>cooperation from the Russians, was a surprise and a delight to me.</p>
<p>These observations were the inverse of the measurements made later </p>
<p>with the U. S. Navy's Transit satellite navigation system. Those </p>
<p>satellites are tracked accurately from known locations and their </p>
<p>exact orbital constants are transmitted up to the satellites and </p>
<p>then retransmitted by the satellites themselves, as a part of the </p>
<p>signals observed by the navigators. This device was set up quite </p>
<p>early in the Space Age and has given excellent service ever since. </p>
<p>As an aid to navigation the method suffers from only two defects: </p>
<p>that a determination of position is available only when a satellite </p>
<p>is nearest to the navigator, which limits observations to once in an </p>
<p>hour, or less, and the unpleasant fact that the errors depend </p>
<p>critically upon precise knowledge of the speed and direction of the </p>
<p>vehicle. Transit is, however, a good and useful system, and it </p>
<p>pleases me to have seen that its principles were understood so well </p>
<p>at such an early date in the age of artificial satellites.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>My happiest period on this trip to England was when I visited Dr. </p>
<p>Essen at Teddington. We had entertained him at our home in America </p>
<p>several times and he and Mrs. Essen were apparently happy to let me </p>
<p>stay with them for a few days. At the laboratory I had the pleasure </p>
<p>of seeing the first cesium resonator that Dr. Essen had developed. </p>
<p>This was a passive device; meaning that an oscillator with </p>
<p>adjustable frequency could be tuned until a maximum response was </p>
<p>obtained, at which point the oscillator frequency was proved to have </p>
<p>an accurately known value. Dr. Essen believed that he could judge </p>
<p>this frequency to a part in ten billion (American billion). I was </p>
<p>allowed to try it myself and felt that one part in a billion was </p>
<p>about all I could feel confident of, but I would never think of </p>
<p>doubting Dr. Essen. I have told above of the cooperative </p>
<p>measurements we made that proved the accuracy he claimed and even </p>
<p>much more as the years went by. It was, however, quite a thrill to </p>
<p>operate this first device that introduced a new order of precision </p>
<p>to the world.</p>

<font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Change"></a></p>
<p>Doctor and Mrs. Essen had four daughters. My Catherine often spoke </p>
<p>affectionately of the time in Arlington when Dr. Essen had told us </p>
<p>that when the third one arrived and was twins, it was a bit much! In </p>
<p>1957 the two elder daughters were among the young people who had </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p>Change Ringing</b> 284</p>
<p>brought new life to the ancient art of ringing changes. All bell </p>
<p>ringing had been suspended during the war as the church bells were </p>
<p>ordered reserved for a warning of invasion or some other emergency. </p>
<p>Many people had felt that change ringing would become a lost art </p>
<p>because many or most of the ringers were old men. To the surprise of </p>
<p>these pessimists, ringing became a very popular pastime among the </p>
<p>young, who frequently formed parties to drive around England on </p>
<p>weekends, stopping to ring the bells for a half-hour or so at as </p>
<p>many churches as possible.</p>
<p>Ever since first reading Dorothy Sayers' novel The Nine Tailors, I </p>
<p>have been fascinated by the idea of ringing changes, which is the </p>
<p>art of altering the sequence of strokes on a group of bells, not to </p>
<p>play a tune, but in response to some mathematical pattern based </p>
<p>fundamentally upon interchanging the positions of next neighbors in </p>
<p>a sequence. When followed to the limit, each bell will occupy in </p>
<p>turn every possible position among those of its neighbors until </p>
<p>finally the order of ringing returns to its original form, which is </p>
<p>ringing in turn from the highest to the lowest pitch. With only four </p>
<p>bells this full peal requires only 24 changes (a change comprises </p>
<p>one stroke on every bell), but ringing on 12 bells would need no </p>
<p>less than 479,001,600 changes, or a lifetime of ringing. Peals can </p>
<p>be rung on any number of bells a church may have, and bobs (or </p>
<p>planned irregularities in the sequence) may be inserted to delay the </p>
<p>recurrence of the original sequence when the number of bells is </p>
<p>small. It is customary to regard the rate of ringing as about 24 </p>
<p>changes per minute or, in most cases, from two to four strokes per </p>
<p>second. These statements, I must make clear, are true only to the </p>
<p>extent of my understanding of what I am writing about, which is </p>
<p>severely limited on this subject.</p>
<p>When several thousand changes are required, it is clear that the </p>
<p>human mind cannot remember the sequence, even for only one of the </p>
<p>bells. I have been told, however, that it is possible to memorize </p>
<p>the pattern which controls the pattern. At this point my </p>
<p>understanding fails to deal with the problem. It is clear, </p>
<p>nevertheless, that people do ring changes.</p>
<p>The bells for change ringing are not stationary and struck by </p>
<p>hammers, as in a carillon, but are suspended on an axle and rung by </p>
<p>pulling a rope attached to a wheel on the axle. Before a peal the </p>
<p>bells are rung up, or swung until each goes just over the top where </p>
<p>it is checked and held upside down until its right moment in the </p>
<p>sequence. The hardest thing for me to understand is how a ringer </p>
<p>learns to time his pull, which must depend in part upon the size and </p>
<p>weight of the bell he is to follow. This is apparently done, not by </p>
<p>listening to the preceding bell (whose sound arrives too late), but </p>
<p>by watching the man (or girl) who pulls the corresponding rope. And </p>
<p>which rope to watch must change after nearly every sequence!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="bells">More about Bell Ringing</b> </a>285</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had never heard change ringing, to say nothing of watching it, </p>
<p>before I discovered that on the Sunday that I spent with the Essens </p>
<p>the local group was going to ring a quarter peal, or about 45 </p>
<p>minutes of changes, before the evening service. I begged for and was </p>
<p>granted the opportunity to watch the ringing and was politely </p>
<p>accompanied by Dr. Essen who, to my surprise, had never watched it </p>
<p>himself. It was a fascinating evening. The leader occasionally made </p>
<p>a cryptic remark, presumably to forestall or correct an error, but </p>
<p>verbal silence prevailed in the ringing chamber for the most part. </p>
<p>The actual energy required was not forbiddingly large, as after each </p>
<p>stroke the bell was checked again in the inverted position. The only </p>
<p>force required (after the original ringing up) was the little needed </p>
<p>to start the bell into its swing, and perhaps a little to check the </p>
<p>bell when it had again reached the top. Ringing for several hours </p>
<p>must be, nevertheless, a wearing experience although the exercise of </p>
<p>so much mental skill is sure to keep it interesting.</p>
<p>Doctor and Mrs. Essen's daughters Judith and Margaret were so kind </p>
<p>as to send me a Ringer's Notebook and Diary for the following </p>
<p>Christmas. This little book contains a calendar mentioning the dates </p>
<p>on which various famous methods (there must be a hundred or more </p>
<p>differing formulae) were first rung; and also the dates of certain </p>
<p>famous peals. The longest that I find mentioned was a full peal of </p>
<p>Bob Major (140,320 changes on eight bells) rung by fourteen men at </p>
<p>Leeds, Kent, in 1761. Such a number of changes would nominally </p>
<p>require about 28 hours. Fortunately, on the average, each man would </p>
<p>need to ring only for sixteen hours out of the twenty'eight! Most of </p>
<p>the recorded ringing records were limited to 12,000 or 13,000 </p>
<p>changes, or about nine hours. There is one mention of 17,824 changes </p>
<p>of Oxford T. B. Major that were rung at Heptonstall in 1927. Any of </p>
<p>these records must be considered a triumph.</p>
<p>I must not forget to record that Dr. Essen also took me to spend a </p>
<p>very pleasant afternoon at Hampton Court, where I tried to lose </p>
<p>myself in the maze and greatly admired everything, especially the </p>
<p>sheer size of the Palace.</p>
<p>I am sure that it was after returning by train from Teddington that </p>
<p>I accidentally watched a moving occasion. For some reason I took the </p>
<p>underground to Leicester Square. I came up into the rain to find the </p>
<p>square crowded with people who, I learned, were prepared to wait two </p>
<p>or three hours to see the Queen arrive at one of the theaters for a </p>
<p>Command Performance. There would obviously be a long wait, so I went </p>
<p>somewhere for dinner and, still finding the time not ripe, stopped </p>
<p>in at a newsreel theater for an hour or so. When the moment came I </p>
<p>had found an excellent vantage point, not much over fifty yards from </p>
<p>the theater marquee, although the crowd was still continuing to </p>
<p>increase and filled the large square pretty tightly. When the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="queen">The Queen</b> </a>286</p>
<p>procession of limousines arrived, the Queen thoughtfully posed under </p>
<p>the protecting roof for a minute or more, so that the crowd could </p>
<p>cheer her. She was dressed in white and every woman in the crowd </p>
<p>cried out, "Oh! She's wearing her emeralds!" I could believe that </p>
<p>she was wearing all of them because, to me, her costume seemed about </p>
<p>half white and half scintillating green. Notwithstanding this </p>
<p>distant view of a few million pounds' worth of emeralds, I was most </p>
<p>pleased, and actually deeply moved, by the patience and devotion of </p>
<p>the admiring crowd.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>As I remember no details of the return trip from England, I feel </p>
<p>sure that it must have been more expeditious than the outward </p>
<p>flight. I think that it may even have landed in Boston, although I </p>
<p>am by no means sure. In any event, I can be confident that I was </p>
<p>delighted to be at home with my family again, and warm enough!</p>

<b><p><a name="Polaris">Polaris Communications</a></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Polaris Project Office in the U. S. Navy was the administrative </p>
<p>organization that planned the creation of the first generation of </p>
<p>submarines armed with ballistic missiles. It was probably in 1957, </p>
<p>well before the first such submarine was launched, that I was </p>
<p>appointed to the Polaris Command Communications Committee. This </p>
<p>surprised me somewhat as I felt that I had some qualifications with </p>
<p>respect to navigation, while my knowledge of advanced communication </p>
<p>techniques was quite ordinary. The appointment perhaps should not </p>
<p>have surprised me, as the navigation for the Polaris ships was </p>
<p>already in a strong position. It was based upon very advanced </p>
<p>inertial devices and, for updating the inertial, automatic sextants </p>
<p>that were controlled by a computer and saw the stars through a </p>
<p>periscope. Inertial navigation, or automatic tracking of direction </p>
<p>and integration of all changes in speed, was especially good on a </p>
<p>submarine because when deeply submerged there is little or no random </p>
<p>motion of the kind so conspicuous on a surface ship or an aircraft. </p>
<p>The celestial updating was nearly as completely automatic. The </p>
<p>navigator would name a star to the computer. The machine then would </p>
<p>consider the time, the geographic position of the submarine, and the </p>
<p>direction in which the ship was headed and so point the sextant that </p>
<p>the observer would find the star near the middle of the field of </p>
<p>view of the instrument. Slight adjustment of the altitude and </p>
<p>azimuth controls would then bring the star to the cross-hairs in the </p>
<p>center of the field. After this adjustment had been made, the push </p>
<p>of a button would send the necessary adjustments to the computer to </p>
<p>correct the former error of the sighting. This process could be </p>
<p>repeated for as many stars as desired, and the computer would </p>
<p>immediately display the latitude and longitude, or the distance and </p>
<p>direction to a desired point, or the ship's course and speed, or </p>
<p>whatever other information might be desired.</p>
<p>A problem with both these devices was that the data could not be </p>
<p>carried forward indefinitely long when the submarine was far below </p>
<p>the surface. The inertial navigation, while very accurate, had </p>
<p>errors that increased more or less in proportion to the time since </p>
<p>the vessel had last been at a known position. Depending upon </p>
<p>circumstances, such as the distance from a potential danger, the </p>
<p>inertial navigation alone might be accurate enough for many hours </p>
<p>but not for several days; and by no means adequate for the Polaris </p>
<p>submarines that were supposed to lie hidden in the depths of the </p>
<p>oceans for tours of three months at a time. It was obvious that the </p>
<p>correction by celestial observations (called updating) could not be </p>
<p>done unless the submarine came to within periscope depth of the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>288</p>
<p>surface, in which case it was vulnerable to discovery from the air </p>
<p>if not by the radars of surface ships.</p>
<p>The communication aspects of the Polaris effort were faced by </p>
<p>similar problems. It was apparently inviolable doctrine that an </p>
<p>order was not complete until an acknowledgment had been received. </p>
<p>This meant that even though a very-low-frequency radio signal could </p>
<p>be received at a distance of several thousand miles when a few tens </p>
<p>of feet below the surface of the ocean, an order to fire could not </p>
<p>be carried out until it had been acknowledged. This appeared to </p>
<p>force the submarine to come to the surface so that it could confirm </p>
<p>the order by high-frequency radio. This seemed an unfortunate thing </p>
<p>to require at such a critical time. Even worse, one could foresee a </p>
<p>more or less extended series of signals which could be expressed in </p>
<p>the vernacular as: "I thought I heard you say fire. Did you mean </p>
<p>it?" "Yes, I said fire!" " Well, give me the countersign so that I </p>
<p>know that you are really you." And so on.</p>
<p>Bringing an offensive weapon-carrying submarine to the surface for </p>
<p>such an interchange, even if compressed into a series of code </p>
<p>signals (which might of course be vulnerable to espionage) seemed to </p>
<p>cast a certain doubt upon the basic concept of an undetectable </p>
<p>threat.</p>
<p>It was obvious that orders for the Polaris submarines were expected </p>
<p>to be sent by VLF radio (about which I now realize I was beginning </p>
<p>to be a minor expert), because the Navy was adding to its existing </p>
<p>network of such stations two much more powerful ones in Australia </p>
<p>and in Maine. In fact, a lot of Polaris money was added to other </p>
<p>funds to expedite the work already going on in Maine. It was one of </p>
<p>my pleasures in this connection to visit the site of the Maine </p>
<p>station at least every year or so while it was being completed. As a </p>
<p>matter of fact, I had earlier participated with my old friend Dick </p>
<p>Woodward, of the Pickard and Burns research firm, in studies of </p>
<p>several places in Maine in an effort to advise the Navy about the </p>
<p>best location. It of course transpired that our recommendation was </p>
<p>disregarded because the Navy had already bought a suitable site.</p>
<p>I must pause here to offer a parenthetical discussion of the costs </p>
<p>of preparing this site; a story that has always amused me. The place </p>
<p>is a rocky peninsula roughly two and a half miles wide and five </p>
<p>miles long. It was originally very rough and sparsely covered with </p>
<p>earth and a scraggly growth of juniper and spruce. The Navy decided </p>
<p>to forestall a lot of haggling with various owners and offered a </p>
<p>flat price of $25.00 per acre. There was local criticism, I was </p>
<p>told, about the spendthrift ways of the Navy in paying so much more </p>
<p>than the land was worth, in those days at least. Having bought it, </p>
<p>it was necessary to clear the land of trees, then remove what soil </p>
<p>there was, blast away the granite to make at least half of the total </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Limitations on Communications / Cost or the Transmitting Site 289</p>
<p>area somewhat smooth, and finally to restore the soil so that some </p>
<p>2,200 miles of heavy copper wire could be properly buried to form </p>
<p>the necessary ground system. In addition to the original twenty-five </p>
<p>dollars, the Navy spent $375 per acre to clear the land and then </p>
<p>$3,000 per acre to grade it!</p>
<p>I approached my duties on the Communication Committee with the </p>
<p>possibly silly idea that the response equivalent to "Aye, Aye, Sir" </p>
<p>ought not to be necessary in the case of the Polaris submarines. The </p>
<p>substitute, in my opinion, could only be a mechanism so completely </p>
<p>reliable that the mere making (naval for sending) a signal would </p>
<p>assure its reception. To achieve such a system would require two </p>
<p>parts. One was to have a transmitter that could not be interdicted </p>
<p>by enemy action or by accident. The second problem would be to </p>
<p>propagate the signals under water to any depth to which the </p>
<p>submarine might need to go.</p>
<p>By the time of the second meeting of the committee, I had prepared a </p>
<p>memorandum of which I was quite proud. The first part was the </p>
<p>description of a diffuse transmitter for VLF signals. This proposal </p>
<p>drew upon my studies of the phase stability of signals in that </p>
<p>frequency region. I visualized a group of 50 to 100 relatively low-</p>
<p>powered transmitters, each of which would drive an antenna </p>
<p>consisting of a thousand-foot television tower with long top-loading </p>
<p>cables to increase its capacitance. These units would be spaced at </p>
<p>least fifteen or twenty miles apart in an area two hundred miles or </p>
<p>more in each dimension. This separation was supposed to be enough so </p>
<p>that an atomic bomb would not destroy more than one of the units. </p>
<p>The signals emitted by these ten-kilowatt stations would be combined </p>
<p>by computer in any of several ways, with intercommunication through </p>
<p>land lines, or VHF radio, or both, in any of several ways. An </p>
<p>antenna in the center of the group might begin. A precise number of </p>
<p>microseconds later its signal would be joined by those from the </p>
<p>nearer towers, and so on, so that the signals,would be added in </p>
<p>phase to produce an omnidirectional signal equivalent to that of a </p>
<p>single station of far greater power. Or a signal could be started in </p>
<p>a given direction by the station at the greatest distance from the </p>
<p>desired objective, with the signals from the other units </p>
<p>contributing their shares as the first signal passed by. This would </p>
<p>add their amplitudes in a way to provide a directional signal with </p>
<p>any desired angular width and a signal strength that could not be </p>
<p>approached by a single transmitter of any achievable power. Or some </p>
<p>fraction of the units could be combined for either of these </p>
<p>purposes, or some other, at the same time. I also believed that this </p>
<p>entire network of low-power elements could be built for less than </p>
<p>the cost of the Cutler station.</p>
<p>The signal from such an indestructable transmitter would not be </p>
<p>noticeably affected by the loss of one or a few elements. Thus, in </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="reliability">My Reliability Proposals</b> </a>290</p>
<p>my estimate, all maintenance could be performed element by element; </p>
<p>and the destruction of the entire diffuse transmitter by an enemy </p>
<p>would require a disproportionate amount of effort. The signal, </p>
<p>therefore, should always be available.</p>
<p>The second part of my problem I regarded as impossible to solve by </p>
<p>radio, as the attenuation of the signals in salt water would make </p>
<p>them useless at a hundred feet or so below the surface. I therefore </p>
<p>proposed a change to underwater sound transmission. This would </p>
<p>require a large number of relatively simple buoys each containing a </p>
<p>radio receiver and a low-powered sonic sounder. These would </p>
<p>translate the radio signals into acoustic ones that could be heard </p>
<p>at any depth, at a distance of a several miles. These buoys would be </p>
<p>anchored with the radio antennas at a depth of twenty or thirty </p>
<p>feet, and the sonic transmitters might be at any point along the </p>
<p>anchor cable that fitted the depth of the water and its temperature </p>
<p>gradient. These buoys would be sown liberally over a large area in </p>
<p>such numbers that there would be little correlation between the </p>
<p>detection of a sound signal and the presence of a Polaris submarine.</p>
<p>I was, as I have said, quite proud of this proposal. The Navy </p>
<p>considered it to the point of contracting with the General Electric </p>
<p>Company to study it, under the name of Arrow. This name, in a </p>
<p>conceit sometimes used in those days, was meant to indicate the </p>
<p>Pierce project, as all the people involved were old enough to </p>
<p>remember the Pierce-Arrow automobile. Incidentally, the neatest use </p>
<p>of this principle I knew of, was when my friend and former </p>
<p>collaborator, Ted Hunt, devised a system for flooding an area with </p>
<p>underwater sound so that the presence and positions of vessels could </p>
<p>be determined. This was, at that time, called the Artemis project, </p>
<p>as Artemis was the goddess of the hunt.</p>
<p>The GE Company produced a classified report on Arrow, in several </p>
<p>volumes that must have weighed a total of six or eight pounds, but </p>
<p>thereafter I do not believe that I heard of it again. My underwater </p>
<p>sound outlets did not achieve even that amount of attention. It is </p>
<p>possible that my work (or that of GE) may have had, some influence </p>
<p>on the development of the idea of using radio, transmission at low </p>
<p>audible frequencies for communication with submarines deep in the </p>
<p>ocean. This work has been hidden under military security </p>
<p>classification for a quarter of a century or more, except that the </p>
<p>subject has leaked out into newspapers from time to time. I have </p>
<p>never managed to have much confidence in this concept, but time and </p>
<p>improving techniques may prove me wrong.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of action on my initial ideas, I continued to try </p>
<p>to be useful, both on the committee and in my own experimentation, </p>
<p>for several years. Somewhere along the way, probably in 1960 when </p>
<p>the first Polaris submarine was commissioned, I believe the entire </p>

<b><p><a name="award">A Very Minor Award / Cutler </a></b>291</p>
<p>membership of the committee received certificates of commendation </p>
<p>from the Secretary of the Navy. This was the only award I ever </p>
<p>received without any trace of fanfare. The certificate simply turned </p>
<p>up in the mail and was never mentioned at a committee meeting.</p>
<p>Watching the VLF transmitter grow at Cutler, Maine was very </p>
<p>interesting. Everything about it was of unprecendented size. The </p>
<p>antenna consisted of two halves each a mile and a half or so in </p>
<p>diameter. Metal cables extended from a thousand-foot tower in the </p>
<p>center somewhat fanwise to cover the spaces between six slightly </p>
<p>lower towers half way to the outer edge, and then continued to come </p>
<p>toward points at six more towers some eight hundred feet high at the </p>
<p>edge itself. Thus each of the two antennae consisted of six </p>
<p>diamond-shaped panels of cables. All were insulated from the towers </p>
<p>by trains of porcelain insulators about thirty feet long. At each </p>
<p>supporting point at a tower, there was a counterweight weighing, I </p>
<p>believe I remember, 110,000 pounds, that permitted the antenna to </p>
<p>sag somewhat if it were under unusual strain from wind or ice </p>
<p>loading. I have mentioned above the 2,200 miles of wire buried under </p>
<p>the antennae (and extending into the Gulf of Maine on both sides) to </p>
<p>provide the earth connection.</p>
<p>I was especially interested in the two loading coils required to </p>
<p>resonate with the capacitance of the antennae at the operating </p>
<p>frequency. Each of these was housed in a shielding helix house of </p>
<p>aluminum in the form of a cube about a hundred feet on a side. In </p>
<p>the center, the coil itself was a helix of a dozen or more turns </p>
<p>about twenty feet in diameter and much the same in length. These </p>
<p>were wound of the largest Litzendraht wire I ever expect to see. </p>
<p>Each strand consisted of a few thousand fine wires braided around </p>
<p>the surface of a rope half an inch in diameter. A large number of </p>
<p>these strands were then formed upon the surface of another rope </p>
<p>about three inches in diameter. This sort of construction was </p>
<p>necessary because at radio frequencies the current in a wire is </p>
<p>insistent on traveling only in a thin layer at the surface. By </p>
<p>making each individual wire as thin as this surface layer a vast </p>
<p>amount of copper can be saved; but then it must follow that hundreds </p>
<p>or (in the case of Cutler) tens of thousands of individual wires had </p>
<p>to be used to achieve the low resistance that is vital in the final </p>
<p>coil.</p>
<p>I have been told that, when in operation, the heat losses in these </p>
<p>loading coils are adequate to maintain a pleasant temperature in the </p>
<p>shielded helix house. On the only occasion when I was in one of </p>
<p>these hundred-foot cubes, the station was not yet operating. The </p>
<p>date was in March and it was a sunny but windy day. I was amazed at </p>
<p>the way this big aluminum cube sucked the heat out of my body, my </p>
<p>winter clothing notwithstanding. It was certainly far less </p>
<p>comfortable inside than outdoors, even on a windy day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="moreantennae">More about the Antennae</b> </a>292</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These twin antennae at Cutler are driven by currents of 14,000 </p>
<p>amperes or so at about a quarter of a million volts. The two, </p>
<p>operated together as is usual, have an input of two megawatts and </p>
<p>radiate about half as much power. This represents a phenomenal </p>
<p>efficiency for a radio station operating at such a low frequency. It </p>
<p>is achieved only by extreme care in controlling the losses in every </p>
<p>part of the antenna, loading coil, and grounding system.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>I came to be a great admirer of a Captain Burke, the naval officer </p>
<p>in charge of the construction at the site. He was working under </p>
<p>great pressure to hurry the work along, and under the handicap of </p>
<p>having to deal with more than forty unions. I never fully understood </p>
<p>how he managed to assign duties so that the various crews kept </p>
<p>completely out of each other's way, while no one was ever noticeably </p>
<p>idle. The work was even finished about a year ahead of the original </p>
<p>schedule.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>The part of studying communications for Polaris that most interested </p>
<p>and amused me was our own development of a method of slow-speed </p>
<p>communication. Our work in precise frequency and timing, and </p>
<p>especially our experiments in cross correlation, had given us the </p>
<p>tools to make good use of almost any degree of reduction of </p>
<p>bandwidth at, of course, the cost of lost speed of signalling.</p>
<p>I have mentioned above the surprising sensitivity of some of our </p>
<p>detection methods, at times when speed was not a problem. We had </p>
<p>also made many measurements of signal strengths and of the ambient </p>
<p>noise levels at low and very low frequencies. We had, therefore, all </p>
<p>the data in hand to permit the design of a communication system </p>
<p>that, I deduced, ought to have at all times completely world-wide </p>
<p>range if used with any of the existing VLF communication stations. </p>
<p>This would be done at the cost of much speed, but it seemed to me </p>
<p>that there was a place for a method that offered immense </p>
<p>reliability, even if slow. It was obvious that the letter A, for </p>
<p>example, might be made to convey a great many differing messages </p>
<p>dependent upon whether it was sent at two P.M., at five minutes past </p>
<p>two, or at midnight, to cite a trivial example.</p>
<p>After some study of expected signal strengths and noise levels, I </p>
<p>decided to try a communication circuit at about three-tenths of a </p>
<p>word per minute or, more exactly, one letter each thirty-five </p>
<p>seconds. Our system was to be fully synchronous, meaning that the </p>
<p>receiver could always know exactly the time at the transmitter, </p>
<p>adjusted for the length of time it took the signal to traverse the </p>
<p>distance between the two places. The plan was to use phase </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="phaseshift">Phase-Shift Keying</b> </a>293</p>
<p>modulation, where the information resided in the phase of a carrier </p>
<p>frequency rather than in its amplitude, as is done with ordinary </p>
<p>on/off keying. A little study indicated that a severe voltage </p>
<p>transient would be produced if the phase of the carrier should be </p>
<p>suddenly reversed. This ought to be avoided because all properly </p>
<p>designed VLF antennae operated at their voltage limit, or the </p>
<p>voltage just less than that at which coronal discharge would be </p>
<p>created; a discharge that would waste a great deal of radiated </p>
<p>power. We calculated that a relatively rapid change of phase of only </p>
<p>ninety degrees, however, would produce a transient not notably </p>
<p>different from that produced by on/off keying. We thus decided on a </p>
<p>phase pattern using four positions separated by exactly ninety </p>
<p>degrees.</p>
<p>Calculation of various possibilities led us to what seemed a useful </p>
<p>arrangement. We made up a code using one of four phases in each of </p>
<p>six time intervals. We established two rules that seemed satisfacto </p>
<p>ry to us: that there would never be a phase shift that was not </p>
<p>exactly ninety degrees; and that a character would always consist of </p>
<p>an equal number of phases taken positively and negatively from a </p>
<p>zero reference phase. There would thus be a constant mean phase, </p>
<p>whatever the character transmitted, so that an averaging circuit </p>
<p>could permit continuous locking to the transmitted frequency.</p>
<p>With these limitations on changes it was clear that in six active </p>
<p>time segments (that started after one segment that was always at </p>
<p>zero phase) there could be only either one or two positive </p>
<p>excursions matched with an equal number of negative ones. The 180 </p>
<p>degree phase became impossible because it would take two steps to </p>
<p>get to it and two to return; there would not be time to have an </p>
<p>equal excursion in the opposite phase.</p>
<p>In summary, these restrictions permitted only 32 useful combinations </p>
<p>of phase patterns out of 4^6 or 4096 combinations. Very roughly, a </p>
<p>signal received in error could be recognized as wrong more than 99 </p>
<p>percent of the time. This is not entirely right as there was a small </p>
<p>possibility that a positive phase error might be balanced by a </p>
<p>negative one to make up an actual character that could not be </p>
<p>recognized as wrong.</p>
<p>A more precise analysis shows that if the signal-to-noise ratio were </p>
<p>high enough so that one recognized error would be made in each 50 </p>
<p>letters transmitted, or once in thirty minutes at our proposed rate </p>
<p>of speed, an undetected error should happen only once in 6,000 </p>
<p>characters, or once in two and a half days.</p>
<p>The important thing about the thirty-two legitimate signals was that </p>
<p>this is the number of characters in a common teletype machine. In </p>
<p>the teletype the five bits that identify the 32 characters are sent </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="phasecode">Translating the Phase Code</b> </a>294</p>
<p>and received simultaneously (or in parallel), whereas our system </p>
<p>would transmit them in series, or one at a time. Our device made the </p>
<p>necessary translation by using a family of relays with many </p>
<p>contacts. As each of the six signal elements was identified a relay </p>
<p>indicating that phase and that time element was locked up. At the </p>
<p>end of the six elements, five circuits through the various contacts </p>
<p>were connected to the teletype so that it would print the required </p>
<p>letter. Any teletype character could be used to indicate a character </p>
<p>that had not been correctly received. In our case, we planned to </p>
<p>experiment using English text, so we simply arranged that the </p>
<p>teletype would print a space if the letter did not come through </p>
<p>unambiguously.</p>
<p>A phase detector is a device that produces an output voltage </p>
<p>proportional to the sine of the phase difference between an incoming </p>
<p>signal and a local reference having exactly the same frequency. For </p>
<p>plus or minus 90 degree shifts, a phase detector would simply have a </p>
<p>plus or minus voltage output of a standard size. By using two phase </p>
<p>detectors with their local reference phases in quadrature (or 90 </p>
<p>degrees apart), we had two different voltages that might be either </p>
<p>positive or negative. Besides applying these voltages to our relays, </p>
<p>we exhibited them as deflections on an oscilloscope so that, say, </p>
<p>zero degrees was straight up, 90 degrees was to the right, minus 90 </p>
<p>degrees, to the left, and 180 degrees straight down.</p>
<p>Timing circuits in our receiver detected that one of each seven </p>
<p>segments which was always at zero phase, and measured off five </p>
<p>second intervals from this zero of time. The next six five-second </p>
<p>intervals contained the six phase elements of our code. The phase </p>
<p>detector outputs were summed up in integrating capacitors. At the </p>
<p>end of each segment the capacitors were discharged. Thus in each </p>
<p>five'second interval the voltages built up more or less steadily in </p>
<p>the capacitors, positively or negatively as required by the two </p>
<p>phase detectors. Nothing mattered to the teletype except the values </p>
<p>held at the end of each five'second interval.</p>
<p>It is perhaps time that I mentioned the characteristics of noise, </p>
<p>particularly in the low radio frequencies. The major source of </p>
<p>natural noise is flashes of lightning, which occur somewhere on </p>
<p>earth about a hundred times a second, on the average. The natural </p>
<p>signals are subject to much the same attenuation as man-made </p>
<p>signals, and attenuation rates in the VLF region are so low that it </p>
<p>is, at times, possible to hear almost all of the lightning flashes. </p>
<p>Fortunately, most of the energy in each flash is expended in a few </p>
<p>hundred microseconds, although a low level of noise is produced for </p>
<p>several milliseconds. When one uses a hard limiting receiver in </p>
<p>which circuit devices prevent more than a certain level of output no </p>
<p>matter how loud the input, a noise pulse cannot cause more output </p>
<p>than can any signal that is strong enough to reach the limiting </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Translating the Phase Code 295</p>
<p>level. This signal level may be very low as it depends primarily </p>
<p>upon the amount of amplification available in the receiver, and this </p>
<p>may be quite large.</p>
<p>Now it is characteristic of noise that the signal it produces in a </p>
<p>receiver has a phase that is, in the long run, perfectly random. For </p>
<p>a moment, or for any short period, the noise phase may have any </p>
<p>value but, as time passes, other noise impulses sooner or later will </p>
<p>have, all possible phases. In an integrating circuit, like the cap </p>
<p>aci' tors in the outputs of our phase detectors, the effect of </p>
<p>random noise will be zero if the integration time constant is </p>
<p>infinitely long. The important question is how much of the </p>
<p>integration time is filled by noise pulses that mask the desired </p>
<p>signal. In our five second integration time, it seemed that having </p>
<p>even as little as five or ten percent of the time free of noise </p>
<p>bursts made it very likely that the correct phase would be measured. </p>
<p>The only limit to detection of the phase' modulated signal is when </p>
<p>noise impulses block out all of the time during which we are </p>
<p>listening for a signal. This is like saying that the signal is so </p>
<p>weak that it never rises above the minimum level of the noise. With </p>
<p>modern precision of frequency controls, the integration time may be </p>
<p>made very large indeed, and the improvement in the ratio of the </p>
<p>power of the received signal to that of the ambient noise is always </p>
<p>proportional to this time constant. There is a practical limit, </p>
<p>however, to the integration that can be used, as we surely may not </p>
<p>wish to wait for minutes or hours before we can tell that a signal </p>
<p>is being received.</p>
<p>This process of integration could be watched on the oscilloscope </p>
<p>used with our receiver. I have said above that the deflection of a </p>
<p>spot on the screen should be straight up in the case of a signal </p>
<p>segment having zero phase. In our case the deflection would </p>
<p>ordinarily be about 1-1/2 inches above the center of the screen. A </p>
<p>noise-free signal segment would begin with the spot at the center. </p>
<p>It would then grow linearly upward with time until the end of the </p>
<p>five-second period, when the integrating capacitors would be </p>
<p>discharged and the spot would return instantly to the center. If </p>
<p>there were no signal at all the spot would also start at the center, </p>
<p>but then it would move, randomly, wandering slowly in any direction, </p>
<p>or several directions, and seldom getting more than a half inch or </p>
<p>an inch from the rest position before being returned to the center </p>
<p>at the end of each five-second interval.</p>
<p>When one watched the spot with an ordinary mixture of signal and </p>
<p>noise, it might start in any direction but then would tend upward </p>
<p>with random hesitations or fluctuationq to the right or left. (I am </p>
<p>still speaking of the case of zero phase). The only question asked </p>
<p>of the machine was whether the spot were nearer the vertical or the </p>
<p>horizontal axis at the instant before the capacitors were </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="slowspeed">More about Slow Speed Instrumentation</b> </a>296</p>
<p>discharged. The allowed range of plus or minus forty-five degrees </p>
<p>was usually adequate so that the signal component would be correctly </p>
<p>deciphered. If the signal-to-noise ratio were extremely poor, it </p>
<p>could get quite exciting to watch the spot "struggling" to get into </p>
<p>the proper quadrant before the end of each five-second period.</p>
<p>I am speaking here as if we received signals before having arranged </p>
<p>for transmission in the right code. This was essentially the inverse </p>
<p>of the receiving problem, but easier because the transmitter always </p>
<p>knew what code element would be wanted next. We constructed a </p>
<p>circuit that would change the phase of a signal of the proper </p>
<p>frequency in accordance with instructions received from a standard </p>
<p>5-hole paper tape that was passed slowly through a tape reader, and </p>
<p>provided the proper timing signals for the various phases, including </p>
<p>the reference phase segment that was always at zero phase.</p>
<p>We played with the transmitting and receiving instruments in the </p>
<p>lab, using natural noise with a tiny signal from a local </p>
<p>transmitter, until we were satisfied with the reliability of the </p>
<p>mechanism. It happened that the Radux transmissions in Hawaii had </p>
<p>been discontinued, and the experimental navigational work was being </p>
<p>done at VLF using the large antenna at Haiku. This made the small </p>
<p>TCG antenna available for our experiment, as the staff from the Navy </p>
<p>Electronics Laboratory could easily administer the slow-speed </p>
<p>transmissions without interfering at all with the navigational work. </p>
<p>We therefore sent the transmitting signal generator to Hawaii for an </p>
<p>experiment that consisted entirely of allowing the NEL people to </p>
<p>punch any messages they pleased on the paper tape and then see if we </p>
<p>could read the signals at Cambridge.</p>
<p>We had chosen a frequency of 17.2 kHz for this experiment because it </p>
<p>was near the center of the region most used for VLF communications, </p>
<p>and because the Navy had an allocation for the use of that </p>
<p>frequency. The small antenna at Haiku was extremely inefficient at </p>
<p>such a low frequency. It was possible to radiate only about thirty </p>
<p>watts, or a thousandth or less of the power used by all serious code </p>
<p>transmitters used in that frequency region at that time. I have </p>
<p>already described the pleasure we had in watching the receiver </p>
<p>identify the phase of each segment of the code we used. We had begun </p>
<p>our experiment in early August, when the natural noise is at its </p>
<p>peak, at least in Cambridge, and we were thrilled to find that the </p>
<p>system did work somewhat better than in the example I cited above. </p>
<p>We found that, in the most noisy afternoon hour the machine failed </p>
<p>to identify a letter about once an hour, and incorrectly identified </p>
<p>one somewhat less than once a week.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, just as we were settling into a routine of measuring </p>
<p>the noise levels and comparing them with the error rate of the </p>
<p>machine, the small antenna at Haiku fell down! This brought the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="cutler">Jamming of Cutler</b> </a>297</p>
<p>experiment to an abrupt halt. The interruption turned out to be </p>
<p>permanent, as the Navy seemed to have no money for repairing an </p>
<p>antenna that was not immediately needed for its own purposes. The </p>
<p>experiment was never resumed elsewhere, as it took a long time </p>
<p>before our gear was returned from Hawaii, and because I believed </p>
<p>that we had already demonstrated the real success of the idea. We </p>
<p>had shown the Polaris authorities how much reliability could be </p>
<p>increased at the expense of speed of transmission. I still hope that </p>
<p>this lesson has been of use.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>In the Polaris Committee I learned an amusing story about the way </p>
<p>the Navy sometimes attacks a problem. This tendency is not unique to </p>
<p>the Navy, but it is often seen at its best in a military </p>
<p>environment. When the first Polaris submarine, the SSBN Washington, </p>
<p>had been launched and sent on its first trans-Atlantic cruise, the </p>
<p>big new Cutler station (that had been re-assigned the Navy's first </p>
<p>famous call letters, NAA) was in full operation. It operated at a </p>
<p>frequency of 14 kilohertz, or very nearly that which should give it </p>
<p>the maximum reliable range of service. It was a great surprise to </p>
<p>the Navy (and to the Committee) when it was reported that when no </p>
<p>more than half way across the Atlantic Ocean the signal from Cutler </p>
<p>completely disappeared as soon as the submarine's antenna was </p>
<p>submerged to any degree at all. The signals were strong when the </p>
<p>ship was on the surface, but useless when it was submerged.</p>
<p>Investigation revealed that the trouble was simply a bad case of </p>
<p>local interference. The Polaris vessels had many kilowatts of </p>
<p>precisely-controlled four hundred cycle power for computers, and the </p>
<p>antenna leads had been thoughtlessly run through the same conduits </p>
<p>as the power lines. With so much 400 cycle power, the 35th harmonic </p>
<p>coupled into the antenna leads was far stronger than the weak signal </p>
<p>received from Cutler when submerged. The Navy solved the problem in </p>
<p>its own way, because giving the antenna leads their own shielded </p>
<p>conduits was too much trouble. They simply changed the operating </p>
<p>frequency of Cutler to 1 4,700 Hertz, so that no harmonic of the </p>
<p>power frequency would be able to jam the signals. It is to be hoped </p>
<p>that a better solution has been achieved in the intervening years.</p>

<font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="Harold"></a></p>
<p>One of the delights of the Communications Committee was an </p>
<p>opportunity to become better acquainted with Harold Beverage. He had </p>
<p>become a graduate of the University of Maine in 1915, and in the </p>
<p>early twenties had developed the "wave antenna", a powerful </p>
<p>directional receiving antenna for low frequency waves. He did this </p>
<p>so well and reported it in the scientific literature so completely </p>
<p>that, so far as I know, no one has needed to improve or extend his </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Harold Beverage 298</p>
<p>work. We had used this kind of antenna for Loran when conditions </p>
<p>required too long a baseline, and I had often referred students to </p>
<p>Beverage's paper about the antenna as an excellent example of a </p>
<p>scientific report.</p>
<p>At the time of the Polaris work, Dr. Beverage was one of the grand </p>
<p>old men of radio. I had met him a few times, but did not know him </p>
<p>well. His contributions to the Committee were mostly in the nature </p>
<p>of steadying advice, which I needed as much as anyone, and we became </p>
<p>quite friendly.</p>
<p>As Cutler was nearing completion, Harold and I decided to visit the </p>
<p>station together. This resulted in a few days of delightful </p>
<p>traveling. Harold and his wife Patricia flew to Bangor while </p>
<p>Catherine and I drove to Maine. We called on friends of one couple </p>
<p>or the other at various places, spent two days admiring the Cutler </p>
<p>Station and cementing relations with Captain Burke, and then went </p>
<p>back to Orono to visit the University again. Harold had seldom been </p>
<p>there since his graduation but my more frequent visits, and a few </p>
<p>old friends still living in Orono, made our stay there pleasant and </p>
<p>memorable. Some years later Catherine and I were able to revisit </p>
<p>Orono when the University gave Harold an award as one of its most </p>
<p>distinguished Alumni.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>A little later my experiments with phase coding of signals brought </p>
<p>me to an interesting luncheon. Professor Chaffee, my chief at </p>
<p>Harvard after the war, until he retired in the fifties, had for </p>
<p>years been an expert advisor to John Hayes Hammond, Junior. Mr. </p>
<p>Hammond had made something of a name for himself by developing a </p>
<p>radio control mechanism for boats at the time of World War I. He was </p>
<p>a rich man and enjoyed playing with electronic devices at his home </p>
<p>in Gloucester, Massachusetts. This home was an artificial castle of </p>
<p>fair size which still serves Gloucester as a tourist attraction. In </p>
<p>it Mr. Hammond assembled and, from time to time, kept adding to a </p>
<p>large pipe organ that was often used for concerts in the Great Hall </p>
<p>of the castle. He also had an assistant Ed Purinton, who was reputed </p>
<p>to be responsible for anything that Mr. Hammond achieved in </p>
<p>electronics.</p>
<p>Shortly after my work on the slow-speed signalling device, Mr. </p>
<p>Hammond and Professor Chaffee began bothering the Navy about a </p>
<p>similar system they had devised and constructed with the assistance </p>
<p>of Mr. Purinton. Their attempts to interest the Navy were difficult </p>
<p>to disregard as Dr. Chaffee's reputation stood high as that of the </p>
<p>greatest expert on high-powered vacuum tubes, while Mr. Hammond was </p>
<p>a Director of the Radio Corporation of America. A Naval captain, who </p>
<p>knew of my similar work, begged me to visit Gloucester and report on </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Harold Beverage 299</p>
<p>whether the Chaffee-Hammond device was something the Navy ought to </p>
<p>try. Accordingly, I made an appointment through Professor Chaffee </p>
<p>and went to Gloucester one morning to see what had been done.</p>
<p>The Gloucester experimenters had devised a perfectly good method for </p>
<p>transmitting dots and dashes by phase-shift keying. They had, </p>
<p>however, apparently given no thought to the effects of noise </p>
<p>interference that had been my primary consideration. Their device </p>
<p>gave, in the absence of noise, a beautiful clear signal but, of </p>
<p>course, one could do much the same thing with a tin whistle. The </p>
<p>experimenters seemed not to have thought of using the hard-limiting </p>
<p>methods so important in making frequency modulation relatively </p>
<p>noise-free, and had devoted no attention to the various </p>
<p>considerations of bandwidth and time constants that were, and are, </p>
<p>of primary importance in modern communications.</p>
<p>The various demonstrations set up to impress me were interrupted by </p>
<p>a luncheon that really did so, as it was conducted with a maximum of </p>
<p>formality. The four of us mentioned above were ushered into a </p>
<p>circular room some twenty-five feet or more in diameter. The room </p>
<p>was at the back of the castle and looked out directly at the reef of </p>
<p>Norman's Woe, made so famous in Longfellow's poem "The Wreck of the </p>
<p>Hesperus". The four diners were seated at ninety degree intervals on </p>
<p>a circular raised platform with backs against the wall and a table </p>
<p>in front of each. The central part of the room was devoted to a </p>
<p>number of servants in livery, who brought in food and presented it </p>
<p>to us, each at his own table. Conversation had to be conducted in </p>
<p>rather loud voices, but it was not really necessary to shout. The </p>
<p>food was excellent, although I no longer have any recollection of </p>
<p>what we ate.</p>
<p>After a day of tedious salesmanship, varied by this interesting </p>
<p>meal, I found no difficulty in reporting to the Navy that, if they </p>
<p>wished to pursue this matter any further, they should at least </p>
<p>demand some serious attention to the effects of noise on the system; </p>
<p>and that, so far as I could see, any official demonstration would </p>
<p>need to be preceded by a considerable amount of further development. </p>
<p>I was pleased to hear no more of this project, as I had been </p>
<p>somewhat concerned that my relations with Professor Chaffee might </p>
<p>suffer. Perhaps the experimenters found that learning the more </p>
<p>modern techniques of communication demanded rather too much time and </p>
<p>attention to be worth pursuing.</p>

<p>26.</p>
<b><p>Omega</p>
</b><p>This aid to navigation was mentioned above in the hyphenated form </p>
<p>Radux-Omega. That was an early idea of a possible way to take </p>
<p>advantage of the precision of measurements of unmodulated signals at </p>
<p>very low radio frequencies. It was hoped that Radux signals sharing </p>
<p>time and radiated from the same antennas would serve to identify the </p>
<p>carrier cycles being measured. This concept failed to develop </p>
<p>because the VLF component turned out to be useful over far greater </p>
<p>distances than could be reached by the Radux part of the combined </p>
<p>method.</p>
<p>The discussion of Draco above has given some impression of the value </p>
<p>of carrier-frequency measurement. This idea by itself, of which </p>
<p>Omega is one implementation, could not be seriously proposed in </p>
<p>earlier days because of possible losses of the continuity of phase </p>
<p>measurement. In the years after World War II, the reliability of </p>
<p>frequency-deriving circuits and the precision of navigational dead </p>
<p>reckoning were both improving rapidly. These factors made the </p>
<p>potential loss of phase continuity less to be feared, and made the </p>
<p>re-establishment of position more accurate in case continuity should </p>
<p>be lost. The use of very low frequencies could in itself make an </p>
<p>important contribution because phase ambiguities would be separated </p>
<p>by distances of a few miles, making the re-establishment of position </p>
<p>by dead reckoning more feasible.</p>
<p>In the years since something like Omega was first proposed these </p>
<p>worrisome problems have nearly vanished. Today there is almost no </p>
<p>doubt that the frequency of the crystal in a uartz watch will be </p>
<p>divided down to count the hours in a day with absolute reliability. </p>
<p>And the precision of dead reckoning has, through the techniques of </p>
<p>inertial navigation, been brought to a very high level, reaching the </p>
<p>order of a mile an hour, or better, even in an aircraft, where </p>
<p>unexpected changes of wind make estimation of course and speed very </p>
<p>difficult.</p>
<p>In the decade of the 1950s, however, it was necessary to approach </p>
<p>the concept of a "pure" carrier-frequency aid to navigation very </p>
<p>cautiously. The early experiments were conducted at single </p>
<p>frequencies below 14 kilohertz, which was the practical lower limit </p>
<p>of the band occupied for long-distance telegraphic communication. It </p>
<p>was possible to borrow the use of large unused, or underused, Naval </p>
<p>transmitting antennas in Hawaii, the Panama Canal Zone, and </p>
<p>elsewhere. And, for a time, the "spare" station of the British Post </p>
<p>Office at Criggion, Wales, also made transmissions for us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>301</p>
<p>By 1958 there was a synchronized pair, operating at 12,500 cycles </p>
<p>per second, between Hawaii and San Diego, but we had at that time no </p>
<p>very accurate idea of the velocity of propagation of radio waves of </p>
<p>such a frequency. As part of an attack on this problem, Commander </p>
<p>Lyle Read, who was the Radux Program Officer at the Navy Electronics </p>
<p>Laboratory, took an early model of a receiver on a voyage from </p>
<p>Hawaii to California. This was primarily to count the number of </p>
<p>cycles in the interference pattern between the signals from the </p>
<p>opposite ends of the path between the stations. This would define </p>
<p>the velocity of propagation, at least for that frequency and time of </p>
<p>day and date. Fortunately the ship got a little ahead of schedule, </p>
<p>and Lyle was able to induce the captain to make a 360-degree turn </p>
<p>somewhere in midpassage. The integrated difference between the </p>
<p>phases of the two signals was being traced by a pen recorder and, of </p>
<p>course, showed a more or less uniform slope proportional to the </p>
<p>speed of the ship. The turn in a circle added a single period of a </p>
<p>sinusoidal modulation to this linear progression. Lyle measured the </p>
<p>amplitude of this sine wave on the record and reported to the </p>
<p>captain, "She seems to turn in 1300 yards". He later told us that </p>
<p>the skipper looked a little dubious and then got out the ship's </p>
<p>book. After studying the reports of the vessel's trials, years </p>
<p>before, he answered, "No, she turns in 1260".</p>
<p>To me, and to many others at NEL and elsewhere, this single incident </p>
<p>gave us our first confidence in the ultimate utility of what came to </p>
<p>be known as Omega. So much sensitivity to the position of a ship in </p>
<p>midpassage in the eastern Pacific Ocean seemed to be such an </p>
<p>important quality that it would justify the immense amount of work </p>
<p>necessary to solve all of the problems of building an effective </p>
<p>system. </p>
<p>It was, of course, recognized that additional transmissions at other </p>
<p>frequencies might be used to solve the cyclic ambiguity. In </p>
<p>principle, transmission at a second frequency ten percent different </p>
<p>from the first would, if the propagational uncertainties in </p>
<p>transmission should be small enough, serve to eliminate nine out of </p>
<p>each ten cycles of ambiguity. Early experiments quickly showed us </p>
<p>that the uncertainties were too large to permit this result. It was, </p>
<p>however, ultimately possible to show that a ratio of four to three </p>
<p>in frequency would usually identify the correct one in each three </p>
<p>cycles. At the lowest frequency ultimately chosen for Omega, 10.2 </p>
<p>kflz, the ambiguities are separated by eight nautical miles or more </p>
<p>of distance. Identification in terms of frequency differences could, </p>
<p>in principle, be repeated several times so that the cyclic ambiguity </p>
<p>would vanish as a practical problem. For several years the Navy made </p>
<p>transmissions at various very low frequencies and observed them at </p>
<p>many places. I recall one experiment, observed only by me, in trying </p>
<p>a lower frequency. This, like much of the early work, ran into the </p>
<p>difficulty that a small antenna will, other things being equal, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="carrier">Trials at Carrier Frequencies</b> </a>302</p>
<p>radiate an amount of energy that varies with the fourth power of the </p>
<p>frequency. The antenna at Chollas Heights in San Diego was designed </p>
<p>for use in the hundred kilohertz region where it would radiate at </p>
<p>least tens of kilowatts of power. In a VLF environment it was very </p>
<p>small, consisting of a network of cables supported by three 625-foot </p>
<p>lattice towers separated in a triangle a thousand feet on a side. At </p>
<p>the Radux frequency of forty to fifty kilohertz it could radiate </p>
<p>several kilowatts. At ten kilohertz, where our first VLF experiments </p>
<p>were made, I believe that the most power that could be radiated was </p>
<p>thirty watts.</p>
<p>On the occasion I found most interesting, the boys in Hawaii had </p>
<p>pieced together all the loading coils they could find and managed to </p>
<p>get the small antenna at Haiku tuned to 6250 hertz. At this </p>
<p>frequency the power radiated could not have been more than a very </p>
<p>few watts. I observed the signal at Cambridge with our photographic </p>
<p>technique, using triggering pulses at a submultiple frequency, so </p>
<p>that a cycle or two stood still on an oscilloscope screen and the </p>
<p>photographic record (which plotted the oscilloscope picture against </p>
<p>time of day) appeared as black and white stripes. During the night </p>
<p>the signal was marvelously clear but at sunrise it declined so </p>
<p>rapidly that at first I thought that the transmitter had been turned </p>
<p>off. This was because the frequency of the signal came close to or </p>
<p>below the cut'off frequency in the waveguide-like space between the </p>
<p>earth and the lowest ionized layer. The height of the layer dropped </p>
<p>suddenly when the first rays of sunlight reached it in the morning, </p>
<p>and the attenuation of the signal increased rapidly. This and one or </p>
<p>two other experiments between six and ten kilohertz convinced us </p>
<p>that reliable long-distance operation was not to be expected at all </p>
<p>hours at a frequency much below ten kilohertz.</p>
<p>In 1963 the Bureau of Ships appointed me chairman of a small group </p>
<p>called the Omega Implementation Committee, which was certainly a </p>
<p>misnomer. It was to be several years before a final decision to use </p>
<p>Omega was taken. Other members of the committee were my old friend </p>
<p>Dick Woodward, and Winslow Palmer of the Sperry Corporation who, as </p>
<p>reported above, designed the first direct-reading Loran receiver. </p>
<p>Win had, in the intervening years, managed to get support for </p>
<p>experimental developments under the name Cyclan, that provided the </p>
<p>first really satisfactory tests of long range navigation in the 100 </p>
<p>kHz frequency region and led directly to the development of the </p>
<p>present Loran C. The fourth and final member of the committee was </p>
<p>Donald Watt, a wavepropagation expert at the Bureau of Standards for </p>
<p>a long time, but currently operating a small research branch of the </p>
<p>Westinghouse Corporation, doing research and consulting in the </p>
<p>propagational field.</p>
<p><a name="Implement"></a>This committee met frequently, most often at Dick's headquarters at </p>
<p>Pickard and Burns. We invited help and advice from many sources, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p>The Implementation Committee</b> 303</p>
<p>even from abroad. Representatives from the British Air Force and </p>
<p>Admiralty were especially active in making their own experiments and </p>
<p>in trying to modify our ideas in directions they thought might suit </p>
<p>them better, but I think that none of their suggested changes were </p>
<p>accepted. There was no formality in the committee meetings, except </p>
<p>for some assignments of reports to be written and brought to the </p>
<p>next meeting. And decisions were made by unanimous agreement </p>
<p>(something, in my experience, only possible in a very small </p>
<p>committee). In most cases there were only two major contributors to </p>
<p>each decision, with the other two members agreeing after discussion.</p>
<p>The committee report was really issued twice, first in June of 1964, </p>
<p>and again in somewhat revised form in May, 1966. This was largely </p>
<p>because a somewhat more desirable method for resolving ambiguities </p>
<p>had been chosen, although there were many minor changes and </p>
<p>improvements. The report contained nearly three hundred pages in </p>
<p>these nine sections:</p>
<p>Part I The System</p>
<p>1. Introduction</p>
<p>2. System Principles and Geometry </p>
<p>3. Propagation</p>
<p>4. Signal Format </p>
<p>5. System Synchronization</p>
<p>Part II Implementation</p>
<p>6. Transmitting Stations </p>
<p>7. System Monitors</p>
<p>8. Omega Receivers </p>
<p>9. Navigation Charts and Compensation Graphs.</p>
<p>My contributions were primarily in sections 2, 3, 4, and 9, on which </p>
<p>subjects I had been making occasional reports for several years. </p>
<p>Sections 3 and 6 were the chief area of interest for Don Watt and </p>
<p>Dick Woodward, although they contributed much to the design of </p>
<p>synchronizing equipment and charting. Win Palmer provided a very </p>
<p>pretty proof that stations at widely separated places could have </p>
<p>their signals brought into coherence without even knowing their </p>
<p>exact locations. He also contributed a far-sighted preview of the </p>
<p>details of a digital receiver, a very advanced idea at that date, </p>
<p>and did much to improve our ideas of instrumentation in every area </p>
<p>of the project.</p>
<p><a name="report"></a>The first five sections of the report comprised all the system </p>
<p>theory and, as far as possible, proofs that it would work as </p>
<p>expected. The last four were matters of implementation, dealing with </p>
<p>possible locations for stations, required transmitter power, design </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p>The Omega Report</b> 304</p>
<p>of receivers and the computation and use of charts and tables for </p>
<p>navigators. These latter sections assumed that the system would </p>
<p>work, as defined in the earlier sections, and gave chiefly rules and </p>
<p>designs for builders and users. The report as a whole was called by </p>
<p>the engineers at NEL "the grey bible" and was, we were told, for a </p>
<p>long time the text for weekly seminars and discussion groups for </p>
<p>those poor people who had to put our instrumental ideas into final, </p>
<p>and actually superb, form.</p>
<p>An interesting feature of the report is an introductory table citing </p>
<p>the number of days of observations (from 4 or 5 up to well over 100) </p>
<p>made on signals from various experimental stations. There were </p>
<p>transmitters in Hawaii, the Panama Canal Zone, San Diego, upstate </p>
<p>New York, and Wales, used in various pairs. Reports are cited from </p>
<p>43 receiving points, covering much of the area from Alaska to Peru </p>
<p>and West Africa, and from the Fiji Islands to Greenland, Iceland, </p>
<p>and England. At this date all antennas were, of course, borrowed. </p>
<p>The major decision of the committee was that there should be eight </p>
<p>transmitters, scattered as uniformly as nature would permit over the </p>
<p>surface of the earth. These would be synchronized in the absolute </p>
<p>sense; that is, the positive-going axis crossings of the antenna </p>
<p>currents at all stations should occur at the same instants of </p>
<p>Greenwich Time. Thus, radical as it might sound at that time, there </p>
<p>should be no master or slave stations, and a navigator could measure </p>
<p>any signal as compared with any other. </p>
<p>In the presumably rare situation when satisfactory signals might be </p>
<p>received from all eight stations, there would be 28 lines of </p>
<p>position that could be measured, and no less than 266 different </p>
<p>positions, accurate or not, that might be determined from the </p>
<p>necessary three stations. The number of hyperbolic fixes varies with </p>
<p>the number of stations successfully received as shown in the </p>
<p>following table:</p>

<font face="Courier New" size="2"><p>The column showing the circular fixes on the previous page is </p>
<p>included because the navigator (or his computer) may prefer to make </p>
<p>a solution in terms of the distance from each station rather than in </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="stationid">Station Identification</b> </a>305</p>
<p>the customary hyperbolic way. Such a solution is possible, even </p>
<p>without knowledge of absolute time, and may be preferred as it is in </p>
<p>some ways more simple. It is not discussed at this time as I found a </p>
<p>reasonably satisfactory mechanism for solving this problem </p>
<p>(algorithm, if you like) only after my retirement and have not tried </p>
<p>to publish it. It offers equal accuracy and often fewer fixes to be </p>
<p>evaluated and weighed for accuracy.</p>
<p>In ordinary Omega practice, the navigator has chosen a pair of lines </p>
<p>of position and determined his position from them only. The choice </p>
<p>of stations is often pre-selected in terms of geographic position, </p>
<p>and is sometimes given with an alternate station or pair in case a </p>
<p>suitable signal is not received from a station first chosen. With </p>
<p>the advent of computer-operated receivers, it is possible to average </p>
<p>many different solutions although the number needed, in the </p>
<p>hyperbolic case, may be large and the selection (or rejection. on </p>
<p>technical grounds) of the appropriate fixes may be rather intricate.</p>
<p>The choice by the committee of the number of stations was in fact </p>
<p>influenced by a rather shameful reason, entirely aside from the </p>
<p>expectation that the number would be adequate. In my original Radux </p>
<p>proposal I had suggested using three stations at a common frequency </p>
<p>with identification of each burst of signal by a difference in the </p>
<p>length of the burst for at least one station. I later refined this </p>
<p>to a method for four stations with signal durations of 9, 10, 11, </p>
<p>and 12 tenths of a second repeated in sequence each five seconds. </p>
<p>Reception from any one station sufficiently clearly to measure the </p>
<p>length of its burst would establish the timing and identify all </p>
<p>signals. When it came time for Omega, I expanded this to a pattern </p>
<p>of 9,10,11,12,11,9,12,10 in a ten second repetition period. This </p>
<p>method was studied essentially by numerical integration of the </p>
<p>overlaps of the pattern with a replica of itself in every possible </p>
<p>phase relation. The choice was the result of tedious searches </p>
<p>through a considerable number of somewhat similar patterns. No one </p>
<p>else ever suggested a better pattern and I was by no means anxious </p>
<p>to repeat the long search for a pattern suitable for a different </p>
<p>number of stations. The choice of eight was therefore somewhat </p>
<p>constrained by a dislike of the numerical problem of finding a </p>
<p>different identification pattern.</p>
<p>The next major recommendation of the instrumentation committee was </p>
<p>the result of a thoroughgoing attack on the problem of cyclic </p>
<p>ambiguity. We started with a chosen frequency of 10,200 cycles per </p>
<p>second, or hertz. I had originally suggested this number because </p>
<p>things worked quite well at 10 kHz and at the same time I had the </p>
<p>idea that 10 kHz exactly might well be reserved for a worldwide </p>
<p>standard frequency signal. I had recommended this for international </p>
<p>adoption, together with two higher frequencies that I thought would </p>
<p>be appropriate for continent-wide or country-wide use, but these </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="ambiguity">Details of Ambiguity Resolution</b> </a>306</p>
<p>suggestions were never adopted. The Radux work had been done with </p>
<p>measurements made at the 200 hertz modulation frequency. It then </p>
<p>would save me some trouble in building my first Omega receiver if we </p>
<p>adopted 10,200 as the operating frequency! I was later to be sorry </p>
<p>for this choice, because improvement of electric power frequency </p>
<p>control techniques ultimately brought the precision of 50 and 60 </p>
<p>hertz power lines to such a close tolerance that high harmonics </p>
<p>radiated by those lines could create serious interference at times </p>
<p>over and near land. It would have been better if we had offset the </p>
<p>Omega frequencies from such simple numbers by choosing, say, a </p>
<p>frequency of five megahertz divided by 1191 (yielding a frequency of </p>
<p>10,183.29+ hertz) or through division by some other prime number.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, a train of 10.2 kHz waves can be made to beat </p>
<p>with a similar train from another station producing nulls (or any </p>
<p>other points on a cycle that may be chosen for measurement) that are </p>
<p>separated by about eight nautical miles, or more. Our first step in </p>
<p>choosing a way to increase this separation was to suggest making, </p>
<p>from the same stations, a second transmission at 4/3 of the </p>
<p>frequency or 13600 hertz. The difference frequency of 3400 hertz </p>
<p>(which could be deduced in the receiver even though the signals at </p>
<p>different frequencies would be transmitted in separate segments of </p>
<p>the ten-second repetition period) would have ambiguities spaced </p>
<p>three times as far apart as the 10,200 hertz signals, and would </p>
<p>therefore point to one of each three periods as the correct one. </p>
<p>Ambiguity would thus be reduced to intervals of 24 miles. Another </p>
<p>step could be taken with transmissions at 12,750 hertz (in the first </p>
<p>committee report) so that the beat between 13,600 and 12,750 Hz, or </p>
<p>850 Hz, would identify one out of each four cycles of 3400 Hz, </p>
<p>increasing the intervals of ambiguity to 96 miles; a distance so </p>
<p>large that we could hope that no navigator would ever find himself </p>
<p>so far off course.</p>
<p>For the second and final committee report it was decided to change </p>
<p>the 12,750 Hz frequency to 11,333 1/3 Hz. This more conservative </p>
<p>scheme was adopted. It was, however, later determined that, in </p>
<p>effect, difference frequencies had more stable phases than the </p>
<p>carriers. The earlier proposal would probably have worked just as </p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>While this ambiguity resolution in 72-mile intervals would </p>
<p>presumably be adequate for any vessel with an active navigator, the </p>
<p>committee had a sympathetic appreciation of the plight of a lost </p>
<p>sailor or airman, whose problem is comparable to that of locating </p>
<p>drifting ocean weather observatories or other purposes for which </p>
<p>ambiguity resolution by adding phase modulation to the three carrier </p>
<p>frequencies; the modulations being at 226-2/3, 115-1/3, and 11-1/3 </p>
<p>hertz. These further successive stages of lane identification would </p>
<p>extend the distance between ambiguities to 7,200 nautical miles. We </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details of Ambiguity Resolution 307</p>
<p>also pointed out that the 226-2/3 Hz modulation might be used alone </p>
<p>in a simple receiver with accuracy equivalent to that of Radux but </p>
<p>with much greater range, taking advantange of a more expensive </p>
<p>antenna system.</p>
<p>When the Navy became ready to build Omega stations, the three </p>
<p>carrier frequencies were adopted (and a fourth was added many years </p>
<p>later), but the modulation frequencies were never used. The </p>
<p>committtee had recognized that the technical problem of radiating </p>
<p>such modulation at such low frequencies was difficult and would be </p>
<p>expensive; something in the neighborhood of a million dollars per </p>
<p>station. That price, however, we regarded as a small part of the </p>
<p>total cost of a station. The Navy, on the other hand, had little </p>
<p>interest in the lane identification problem, perhaps believing that </p>
<p>the equipment would run with almost perfect reliability (as it does </p>
<p>today), and that it would be used only by human operators. The </p>
<p>officials charged with the building of the Omega system chose </p>
<p>instead to sell the idea of three carrier frequencies to the </p>
<p>admirals as essentially spare transmissions that would be of value </p>
<p>in resisting enemy jamming. I believe that it was many years before </p>
<p>the Navy took any advantage of the lane identification features, or </p>
<p>some of the other potential uses of the multiple frequencies. This, </p>
<p>in my opinion, was all because they did not consider the uses of </p>
<p>Omega for search and rescue as seriously as did the committee.</p>
<p>The synchronization problem was a particularly interesting one. </p>
<p>Suppose, for a moment, that all eight stations enjoy propagation </p>
<p>conditions that are completely uniform. That is, that propagational </p>
<p>velocities are the same for all directions and distances of travel. </p>
<p>This is of course not quite true. Suppose further that every station </p>
<p>has a clock, or frequency and time standard that can be relied upon </p>
<p>to maintain its characteristics so well that no error of important </p>
<p>magnitude will accumulate in less than twenty-four hours. Barring </p>
<p>catastrophic accidents, this may be expected. Now let every station </p>
<p>observe the time of arrival of the signal from every other station </p>
<p>in terms of its own clock, preferably continuously but at least once </p>
<p>per day. If, for example, a station should observe that all the </p>
<p>incoming signals are late by similar amounts, an operator at that </p>
<p>station would have every reason to suppose his own clock to be the </p>
<p>source of the error. He might, with suitable precautions, take the </p>
<p>correct remedial action.</p>
<p>It would be far better for some central authority to receive from </p>
<p>all stations reports of the observations of all signals. He could </p>
<p>then intercompare all observed errors and make an intelligent </p>
<p>decision about what action to recommend (or order) for each station. </p>
<p>If, by some chance, each of a pair of stations should report the </p>
<p>other's signal to be late, the assumption could prudently be made </p>
<p>that both observations were results of a propagational vagary; in </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="synch">Synchronization </a></b>308</p>
<p>this case, action might well be deferred pending the arrival of </p>
<p>later data. In principle, such complete intercomparison of </p>
<p>observations, followed by properly chosen corrections, should result </p>
<p>in making the timing at every station draw closer to the standard </p>
<p>defined by the mean of all of them.</p>
<p>In practice, it is necessary to perform this sort of correction with </p>
<p>several precautions and approximations. In the real world one </p>
<p>station of a pair can receive a satisfactory signal from the other, </p>
<p>while the second station may not be able to reciprocate because of </p>
<p>an east-west difference in the rate of signal attenuation. In this </p>
<p>case the error not well measured must be replaced by values in </p>
<p>effect relayed to the central authority by other stations that did </p>
<p>receive the missing signal. Because all stations cannot be expected </p>
<p>to receive equally satisfactory signals from all other station, some </p>
<p>weighting factors must be assumed and gradually improved as a result </p>
<p>of experience. Also, because of a known slight east-west assymmetry </p>
<p>in the velocity of propagation, small adjustments would have to be </p>
<p>made in the expected times of arrival of signals.</p>
<p>A most important consideration is that all of the observed errors </p>
<p>might be simply results of propagational vagaries. If this could be </p>
<p>known to be the case, of course no action would be taken. In the </p>
<p>absence of such knowledge, only small corrections should be made </p>
<p>until further observations make the situation more clear.</p>
<p>In the practical case, the complete solution of the problem comes </p>
<p>from a study, not only of the current errors, but also whether the </p>
<p>errors are (in recent history) increasing or decreasing and how fast </p>
<p>they are doing so. In simple terms, an observed clock error will </p>
<p>require a large correction if the error is known to be increasing </p>
<p>with time. If the same error is known to be decreasing, the required </p>
<p>correction would be smaller or even possibly in the opposite sense; </p>
<p>the idea being to bring the error smoothly toward zero in such a way </p>
<p>that the corrections would cease just as the right point was </p>
<p>reached.</p>
<p>Again, in the real world, the controller can never win the battle of </p>
<p>adjustments, because the observing, reporting, analysis of the data, </p>
<p>and returning orders to the stations take time, in which new errors </p>
<p>may well be accumulating. I devised a method for dealing with this </p>
<p>problem that depended upon intercpmparison of today's, yesterday's, </p>
<p>and the day-before-yesterday's observations of error. This gave at </p>
<p>least a little information about the apparent error and its first </p>
<p>and second derivatives; that is, the rate and acceleration of its </p>
<p>changes. By a numerical integration (called time series modeling, I </p>
<p>later learned) I tried a lot of cases of assumed errors, both </p>
<p>accidental and real. in various proportions, and reported a </p>
<p>technique that seemed to deal with the real errors effectively. The </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="control">Control Principles</b> </a>309</p>
<p>method amounted, in approximation, to making a correction of about </p>
<p>one fourth of the error observed today, plus one eighth of what was </p>
<p>observed yesterday, plus one sixteenth of the error from two days </p>
<p>ago. Since this series of factors probably overlapped similar series </p>
<p>originating at earlier dates, the summation tended toward zero if </p>
<p>the various errors were accidental, but toward a factor approaching </p>
<p>one-half of the most recently observed error if the variations </p>
<p>represented real errors of timing. To cite a most improbable event, </p>
<p>if a single real timing error should occur, followed by no others </p>
<p>for a considerable time, the transient effect of the error would be </p>
<p>completely corrected in a week or a little more. This method of mine </p>
<p>was used in operation of Omega for some time and, I believe, quite </p>
<p>successfully, but was later replaced by another which I never fully </p>
<p>understood but trust to have been more professional and more </p>
<p>satisfactory. I found it interesting that later still this problem </p>
<p>of coordinating all error correction was taken over by the Japanese.</p>
<p>There would be no point in allowing such a network of stations to </p>
<p>follow its own average time, which would (like any clock) gradually </p>
<p>drift without limit. The U. S. Naval Observatory is therefore given </p>
<p>the duty of monitoring and gradually correcting the timing of all </p>
<p>stations together to bring the timing close to the international </p>
<p>standard. The present excellence of frequency control techniques is </p>
<p>such that the Naval Observatory probably needs to make a correction </p>
<p>no more often than once or twice a year, unless there are other ends </p>
<p>to be served that need more precision than does Omega.</p>
<p>It may occur to a reader to wonder how, in the era when only part of </p>
<p>the Omega stations were operating (which lasted about fifteen years) </p>
<p>a new station could be brought into the network with, all of its </p>
<p>emissions in the proper phases. This was not unduly difficult, </p>
<p>because all of the Omega emissions from a station are locked </p>
<p>together into a tight pattern which repeats precisely every thirty </p>
<p>seconds. A station in a new location, therefore, can initially set </p>
<p>that pattern to very nearly the correct epoch by the best time </p>
<p>signals available. Thereafter it can be brought into exact agreement </p>
<p>with the rest of the network in relatively few days. Usually an even </p>
<p>longer interval has been required before monitoring stations in </p>
<p>various places can give assurance that the timing is exact and the </p>
<p>transmission reliable enough to be announced as available for use.</p>
<p>After each Omega station has made transmissions at three carrier </p>
<p>frequencies in the chosen segments of each ten-second interval, </p>
<p>about five-eighths of the time is available for other services [Four </p>
<p>frequencies, in recent years, occupying about half of the 10-second </p>
<p>period]. The Implementation Committee recommended that, during these </p>
<p>silent periods for Omega, each station should transmit a steady </p>
<p>carrier at one of eight otherwise unused frequencies. These, like </p>
<p>the primary Omega frequencies, would be derived by dividing 408 </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="side">Side Frequencies</b> </a>310</p>
<p>kilohertz by one number or another. These side frequencies, as we </p>
<p>called them, satisfy all the requirements for an ideal Draco aid to </p>
<p>navigation. They are precisely controlled, transmitted from </p>
<p>accurately located antennas placed in useful geographic locations, </p>
<p>and simply related in frequency to each other. The </p>
<p>computer-controlled receivers today, and other navigational </p>
<p>receivers not actually using Omega, are free to use these side </p>
<p>frequencies to constitute a dead reckoning tracker (see the chapter </p>
<p>on Draco) which can add to the knowledge of position in case there </p>
<p>is trouble or doubt about any of the Omega signals themselves. As </p>
<p>the Navy (or now Coast Guard, which actually operates those stations </p>
<p>under United States control) has never managed to build into the </p>
<p>stations enough redundancy to avoid the need to shut down the </p>
<p>transmitters for an annual maintenance period (taken, of course, one </p>
<p>station at a time) these side frequencies are presumably very </p>
<p>useful.</p>
<p>The recommended side frequencies, and the carrier frequencies as </p>
<p>well, are given in the table below. They are all submultiples of 108 </p>
<p>kHz, actually being derived from a source of twice that frequency </p>
<p>for convenience in generating square waves in accurate phase </p>
<p>coherence. The factors, frequencies, and uses are:</p>
<p>Divisor Frequency in Hertz Use</p>
<p>======= ================== =============</p>
<p>40 10200 Omega Carrier</p>
<p>39 10461 21/39 Side Frequency</p>
<p>38 10736 16/19 Side Frequency</p>
<p>37 11027 1/37 Side Frequency</p>
<p>36 11333 1/3 Omega Carrier</p>
<p>35 11657 1/7 Side Frequency</p>
<p>34 12000 Side Frequency</p>
<p>33 12363 7/11 Side Frequency</p>
<p>32 12750 Side Frequency</p>
<p>31 13161 9/31 Side Frequency</p>
<p>30 13600 Omega Carrier</p>
<p>The side frequencies expressed in whole numbers are especially </p>
<p>convenient for use as frequency standards. These two, together with </p>
<p>the carrier and modulation frequencies and the burst modulation used </p>
<p>for Omega station identification, all repeat precisely every thirty </p>
<p>seconds. Data for the Naval Observatory's overriding control of the </p>
<p>exact timing of the Omega signals could be procured by observing any </p>
<p>or all of these signal components.</p>
<p>The side frequencies obtained by dividing by 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, and </p>
<p>39 do not obey the 30'second rule. They are made coherent with each </p>
<p>other by keeping all division frequencies in each station locked to </p>
<p>its 408 kHz standard. There is no requirement for keeping the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="notadopted">Other Ideas that Were Not Adopted</b> </a>311</p>
<p>various stations coherent in this respect, because any potential </p>
<p>user of the Draco-like signals will operate by multiplying the </p>
<p>received side frequencies from various stations up to 408 kHz before </p>
<p>measuring the phase differences. The only requirement is that the </p>
<p>408 kHz standard in each station must not shift erratically.</p>
<p>The committee also planned a system of phase modulation of the side </p>
<p>frequencies for transmission of information from station to station </p>
<p>or from stations to headquarters. This was intended to be much like </p>
<p>the slow-speed communication experiments I mentioned in the last </p>
<p>chapter. This would have been highly reliable and, I think, useful, </p>
<p>but I do not believe that it was ever implemented in the operating </p>
<p>system. It was basically not necessary because the precision and </p>
<p>reliability of each station's frequency standard was such that </p>
<p>intercommunication could almost be carried out by post card. </p>
<p>It finally evolved that the Navy did not accept our recommendations </p>
<p>for the choice of the side frequencies. Perhaps because more </p>
<p>conventionally-defined frequencies might be easier for manufacturers </p>
<p>to use in Draco-like receivers, the frequencies now radiated are </p>
<p>certain multiples of 100 Hertz. How the phase integrity of the side </p>
<p>frequencies is guaranteed I do not know. The list of choices is as </p>
<p>follows:</p>
<p>Station Location Side Frequency in kHz</p>
<p>======= ======== =====================</p>
<p>A Norway 12.1</p>
<p>B Liberia 12.0</p>
<p>C Hawaii 11.8</p>
<p>D North Dakota 13.1</p>
<p>E La Reunion 12.3</p>
<p>F Argentina 12.9</p>
<p>G Australia 13.0</p>
<p>H Japan 12.8</p>
<p>I have no idea why there are gaps in the sequence of frequencies, or </p>
<p>why they are placed as they are.</p>
<p>The recommendation of sites for stations was a curious and </p>
<p>entertaining problem. Having decided on eight stations, various </p>
<p>semi-geometrical patterns came to mind. One might have four stations </p>
<p>north of the equator and four in southern latitudes. Each four might </p>
<p>be at 90 degree differences in longitude. The northern and southern </p>
<p>pairs might be at the same longitudes (at the corners of a cube) or </p>
<p>might be twisted by 45 degrees, so that as longitude increased the </p>
<p>stations would come alternately north and south of the equator. Any </p>
<p>idea of this sort is instantly defeated by study of a terrestrial </p>
<p>globe. Transmitting antennas have to be on land, partly because of </p>
<p>their size but chiefly because their positions need to be accurately </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="sites">Sites for Stations</b> </a>312</p>
<p>known. One discovers immediately that only 29 percent of the area of </p>
<p>the world is land. Only 10 percent lies south of the equator and, if </p>
<p>we exclude Antarctica for practical reasons, only 7 percent is land. </p>
<p>The land areas are very irregularly distributed and islands do not </p>
<p>seem to occur in convenient places for our purposes. It is useless </p>
<p>to describe the many hours I have spent turning a small globe and </p>
<p>measuring distances.</p>
<p>Another problem was that we could not publish a report showing sites </p>
<p>in foreign countries without having given those countries advance </p>
<p>notice, which we certainly were not authorized to do. Also, we could </p>
<p>not always guess what political factors might defeat any suggestion </p>
<p>we cared to make. I did go so far as to ask the State Department for </p>
<p>guidance about a moderate number of suggested places. I was </p>
<p>surprised at how many sites that I felt might be satisfactory were </p>
<p>taboo from the diplomats' point of view. One French island group was </p>
<p>dismissed because installations are planned with which we do not </p>
<p>care to be associated; meaning atomic bombs not our own!</p>
<p>In the end, we published in our report several sets of possible </p>
<p>sites, including those that we rather preferred. I have, while </p>
<p>writing this chapter, taken the trouble to compare this list with </p>
<p>the final locations of the stations. The results are amusing but not </p>
<p>necessarily enlightening. One station remains as in our suggestion. </p>
<p>Six others can be considered to have been moved between 850 and 1300 </p>
<p>nautical miles (in one direction or another), if one makes the </p>
<p>assumption that each was moved from a proposed site to the nearest </p>
<p>actual site. The station now in Liberia remains an exception. It was </p>
<p>apparently moved there from southern Iran, or some other nearby </p>
<p>place, a distance of more than 4000 miles. This case alone may </p>
<p>invalidate the idea that the authorities tried to follow our </p>
<p>preferred list; the rough correspondence of seven of the eight </p>
<p>stations may simply be a statistical accident. It is a further </p>
<p>curiosity that except for the two stations in the United States all </p>
<p>the remaining six have moved from the country we suggested to </p>
<p>another one!</p>
<p>I did not actually feel the need to complain about the relocation of </p>
<p>the first operational station after the one in Hawaii. The Navy </p>
<p>decided that this should be built An Norway, almost at the arctic </p>
<p>circle, instead of in northern or northwestern Ireland. There was at </p>
<p>the time an idea, which we had accepted in our implementation </p>
<p>report, that operation within a few hundred miles of a station might </p>
<p>be unreliable because of an uncertain phase relation between a </p>
<p>ground and a sky wave. We could show that at certain frequencies </p>
<p>this effect should not be serious, but it was then hard to be sure </p>
<p>what frequencies might be the clean ones. In actual fact, I am not </p>
<p>too convinced of the serious nature of this effect, at least for the </p>
<p>Omega frequencies, as I observed signals from Forestport, New York, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sites for Stations 313</p>
<p>in Cambridge, at a distance of some 180 miles, for a long time with </p>
<p>almost no difficulty of this kind. In the case of Ireland, such a </p>
<p>proximity effect might have been serious for vessels or aircraft </p>
<p>arriving in British waters. Similar phenomena off the Norwegian </p>
<p>coast may have been regarded as affecting only Norwegian fishermen, </p>
<p>although I am sure that some departments in the Navy were concerned </p>
<p>about helping navigation in the Norwegian Sea or Barents Sea.</p>
<p>The change from a suggested site in northern Chile was another </p>
<p>matter. Ireland having been moved further north and east, it did not </p>
<p>seem inappropriate to change from Chile to Trinidad. I went to that </p>
<p>island, with one of the naval officials from the Omega Project </p>
<p>Office, to investigate the desirability of the site which had come </p>
<p>under the control of the American Navy in President Roosevelt's </p>
<p>destroyers for bases deal before we entered World War II. I </p>
<p>recommended that this site should not be used, as it would be </p>
<p>impossible to radiate what we regarded as adequate power (defined as </p>
<p>ten kilowatts) from any antenna that could be erected over the </p>
<p>valley containing (at the end of the war) a Naval communication </p>
<p>station glamorously called Hemisphere Radio. Despite my objection a </p>
<p>station was installed there, as will be described below. It never </p>
<p>succeeded in radiating more than about a kilowatt, but was well </p>
<p>received in the Americas and in Europe. After a time and, I think, </p>
<p>after I retired, this station was discontinued and replaced by one </p>
<p>in Liberia; a rather large extension of the length of the first </p>
<p>move. There it provides good service but, because of poorer </p>
<p>transmission toward the west than toward the east, barely reaches </p>
<p>the east coast of the United States with satisfactory signals.</p>
<p>It is perhaps time to explain the identification of the various </p>
<p>stations. They are named, in no particular order, for the first </p>
<p>eight letters in the English alphabet. Each Omega reading is </p>
<p>identified by the proper pair of letters, taken in the sense of, the </p>
<p>time of arrival of the signal from the station whose letter comes </p>
<p>earlier in the alphabet minus the time of arrival of the one bearing </p>
<p>the later letter. The abbreviation AB, for example, identifies time </p>
<p>A minus time B, and is never cited in the reverse order of letters. </p>
<p>With so many cycles (or periods) to be accounted for, it is </p>
<p>necessary to add a fictitious coding delay so that the reading of A-</p>
<p>B will always be positive, no matter which signal takes longer to </p>
<p>arrive. This fictitious quantity is 900 periods of 10.2 kHz. Its </p>
<p>meaning is that the centerline of each pair (or the great circle </p>
<p>perpendicular at the center of the baseline between stations) always </p>
<p>has the identification number 900. A complete reading of the line of </p>
<p>position might be recorded as AB 576.24, for example, as the </p>
<p>readings are customarily made to a hundredth of a period. The total </p>
<p>number of whole lanes (or periods or cycles, in assorted </p>
<p>terminologies) lies between 700 and 1250 for the various pairs, but </p>
<p>always has the average value of 900. The correct notation should </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="moremoving">More Moving / How Readings Are Defined</b> </a>314</p>
<p>always speak of whole or fractional cycles or periods when speaking </p>
<p>of time units, and of lanes when speaking of distance, as the </p>
<p>hyperbolic lines diverge with increasing distance from the </p>
<p>baselines. A lane, therefore, is always thought of as a band eight </p>
<p>or more nautical miles wide between successive integral values of </p>
<p>phase difference.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be observed that many nations cooperate in this effort, and </p>
<p>that the overall geographical distribution is fairly well balanced. </p>
<p>Half of the stations are in eastern longitudes. Only three of the </p>
<p>eight are in southern latitudes, but Monrovia (B) is only six </p>
<p>degrees north of the equator.</p>
<p>The great distances between stations are hard to appreciate, even </p>
<p>for me, and I have been studying their positions and geometries for </p>
<p>thirty years. The average of all the base line lengths (between </p>
<p>pairs of stations) is just over 11,000 kilometers or a little less </p>
<p>than 6,000 nautical miles. It is perhaps more meaningful if, for </p>
<p>each station, we eliminate the longest baseline, as that other </p>
<p>station, we would like to think, ought to be more or less on the </p>
<p>opposite side of the earth. The mean distance to the other six </p>
<p>stations (taken in all combinations) is a little more than 5,400 </p>
<p>nautical miles, or 90 degrees of arc. This is approximately the same </p>
<p>as the distance from Los Angeles across eastern Canada, the southern </p>
<p>tip of Greenland, and England to Rome! The fact that useful </p>
<p>navigation can be performed with radio signals traversing such </p>
<p>distances continues to amaze me.</p>
<p>I have spoken in praise of the stability of modern sources of </p>
<p>frequency, but it is time to discus the matter more fully. Similar </p>
<p>final results for Omega could have been obtained with crystal </p>
<p>oscillators, but only with the devotion of infinitely more care and </p>
<p>effort than is required with the modern cesium-controlled </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="typical">Typical Distances / The Frequency Source</b> </a>315</p>
<p>oscillators. These are much more precise in frequency than the early </p>
<p>ones with which I once worked, and the new ones are markedly more </p>
<p>reliable.</p>
<p>When I write this I realize that I am not telling the exact truth. </p>
<p>In my later years at Harvard, I acquired an oscillator stabilized by </p>
<p>a rubidium resonator. This did not produce quite as accurate a </p>
<p>frequency as a cesium standard, but it was in some ways simpler and </p>
<p>more reliable. This device annoyed me by running well for a week and </p>
<p>then failing. I managed to trace the trouble to the glass vessel </p>
<p>which contained the rubidium vapor. I expressed my disgust by </p>
<p>telephone to the manufacturer, who promptly sent me a substitute </p>
<p>bottle. With great difficulty I managed to take the strange device </p>
<p>apart and replace the vessel. The oscillator immediately began to </p>
<p>behave correctly and then operated continuously and well for the </p>
<p>next eight and a half years! </p>
<p>It is obvious that if two clocks begin to diverge it is not possible </p>
<p>(without reference to some external standard) to tell which one is </p>
<p>in error. If one has three clocks and continuously intercompares </p>
<p>them, it is fair to assume that when one changes the other two are </p>
<p>probably correct. We, in the committee, carried this rule a step </p>
<p>farther, using the argument that these new cesium standard </p>
<p>oscillators were so complex that if one failed it might take a </p>
<p>considerable time to repair or replace it. We therefore demanded </p>
<p>that each station have four cesium-controlled sources of frequency </p>
<p>that would be continuously monitored. In case one began to deviate </p>
<p>from its duty, there would still be a consensus of three that would </p>
<p>guarantee the integrity of the transmitted phases.</p>
<p>We even went so far as to propose a mechanism that would average the </p>
<p>frequencies of the four oscillators so that the station would </p>
<p>operate at the mean of all four, which would presumably be more </p>
<p>accurate than any individual one. More importantly, by having a </p>
<p>device that automatically dropped an oscillator out of the averaging </p>
<p>process if it showed any serious deviation in frequency, this </p>
<p>averaging would provide a frequency source with no possibility of a </p>
<p>phase discontinuity caused by the failure. I believe that this idea </p>
<p>has not been used. It is simpler to maintain the oscillators </p>
<p>separately with continuous intercomparison and with only one </p>
<p>oscillator connected to the frequency generator and transmitter. </p>
<p>This kind of operation demands that should it become necessary for </p>
<p>one of the standby oscillators to replace the active one, those two </p>
<p>outputs would have to be brought into identical phases so that the </p>
<p>transfer could be made by temporarily coupling the two sources </p>
<p>together, thus permitting no alteration of phase. This is exactly </p>
<p>the technique used by electric power companies when another </p>
<p>generating station is to be added to a power grid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b><p><a name="freqavg">Frequency Averaging</b> </a>316</p>
<p>With four cesium-controlled oscillators at each station and eight </p>
<p>stations in the network, the Omega signals become one of the better </p>
<p>standard-frequency sources in the world. It is customary for the </p>
<p>important Standards institutions, such as the Bureau of Standards, </p>
<p>the Naval Observatory, and the Greenwich Observatory, to maintain, a </p>
<p>battery of many such standards, but usually more nearly in one </p>
<p>place. Since my retirement some of my old associations with the </p>
<p>frequency-standard world have brought me data intercomparing various </p>
<p>standards laboratories and signals. It is not too much to say that </p>
<p>timekeeping, at least by such professionals, has reached a stability </p>
<p>of about a millionth of a second per year. It may be doubted that </p>
<p>the oscillators in the Omega network are maintained with such </p>
<p>scrupulous care as those in the standards laboratories, but the </p>
<p>sheer number of intercompared oscillators involved must make the </p>
<p>Omega frequency nearly as stable.</p>
<p>Transmitting antennas for Omega are of two kinds. One, used at the </p>
<p>first two of the operational Omega stations, is the mountain </p>
<p>antenna, where miles of heavy copper-clad cables are strung between </p>
<p>insulators from the peaks of two mountains that are separated by an </p>
<p>unusually narrow and deep valley. The prototype of this was a famous </p>
<p>antenna in Java, built by Dutch engineers in or before 1920.. At </p>
<p>least one end of this antenna was supported by a very high cliff and </p>
<p>it achieved an operating efficiency and amount of power radiated </p>
<p>that was not equalled for many years, perhaps not until the </p>
<p>construction of the Goliath antenna in Russia, or perhaps the </p>
<p>immense antenna at Cutler, Maine. An antenna of this type was </p>
<p>erected during World War II at Haiku, on the island of Oahu. This </p>
<p>consisted of four cables, each about 7,000 feet in length, strung </p>
<p>across the remains of an extinct volcano crater. Its downleads </p>
<p>extended about 1,500 feet from the centers of the strands to the </p>
<p>transmitter building on the floor of the crater. This antenna was </p>
<p>excited, or driven, by one of the old Alexanderson alternators, a </p>
<p>type of electric generator which, by virtue of high rotational speed </p>
<p>and many magnetic poles, actually generated a low radio frequency. I </p>
<p>believe that a score of these machines were built before 1920, and </p>
<p>that thirty years later at least a dozen of them were supposed to be </p>
<p>still in operation somewhere in the world. I have been told that the </p>
<p>operation of each of these machines ceased only when the original </p>
<p>General Electric Company engineers, who were sent to install and </p>
<p>operate them, either died or retired!</p>
<p>The antenna at Haiku worked very well, partly because the site was </p>
<p>in a crater with a bottom a mile or more wide, so that the outer </p>
<p>ends of the antenna cables, where the voltage was at a maximum, did </p>
<p>not hang too close to the conducting earth at the mountain top. A </p>
<p>similar antenna, built in the Cascades in the state of Washington </p>
<p>and used in the Draco experiment, had a disappointing efficiency. I </p>
<p>have always thought that the difference was that this Jim Creek site </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="haiku">Antennas at Haiku</b> </a>317</p>
<p>was in a valley with a very narrow bottom. The large sag of the </p>
<p>heavy cables brought much of their length too close to the slopes of </p>
<p>the mountains on both sides. Jim Creek was indeed very useful as a </p>
<p>large input to the antenna made it one of the more powerful stations </p>
<p>in the world. The amount of power actually radiated, however, was </p>
<p>only about a third of what its designers hoped.</p>
<p>The first Omega-like transmissions from Haiku were made from the </p>
<p>"small" TCG antenna, named for the type number of its transmitter. </p>
<p>This was the antenna used for my slow-speed experiment. This antenna </p>
<p>was a single strand of cable across the same crater but at a </p>
<p>slightly lower height and with only a thousand-foot downlead. It was </p>
<p>used for early tests by NEL, but later the work was transferred to </p>
<p>the main antenna, which had not been in use for years. The Navy </p>
<p>Electronics Laboratory crew working at Haiku were allowed to use the </p>
<p>large antenna under a curious agreement. They could transmit what </p>
<p>signals they pleased provided that they would rotate the armature of </p>
<p>the Alexanderson alternator about 90 degrees once a week, to prevent </p>
<p>it from developing curvature of the spine, or shaft. This reminded </p>
<p>me very much of the traditional Earl or Baron in the Middle Ages, to </p>
<p>whom the King granted a huge estate in consideration of the payment </p>
<p>of an annual rose, or falcon, or some similar testimonial to </p>
<p>subservience.</p>
<p>Even the large antenna at Haiku was somewhat inadequate at ten </p>
<p>kilohertz. When it came time to promote the station from experiments </p>
<p>to full Omega operation, I believe that the four strands of antenna </p>
<p>were increased to six, thereby achieving ten kilowatts of radiated </p>
<p>power. This was an early estimate of what was needed, but operation </p>
<p>of Trinidad at low power had shown the desirability of such an </p>
<p>increase.</p>
<p>The second type of antenna used for Omega is the umbrella. This is a </p>
<p>single central tower surrounded by radial cables extending from the </p>
<p>top of the tower toward the ground at considerable distances. These </p>
<p>many radials have insulators at such a distance from the tower that </p>
<p>they hang at about half its height. The remainder of each radial is </p>
<p>interrupted by several more insulators, so that the antenna part is </p>
<p>well isolated from the ground system below. For use at the Omega </p>
<p>frequency such a central tower should be about as high as any </p>
<p>man-made structure. I believe that the one at Tsushima is at least </p>
<p>1500 feet in height. In that case, the central tower takes the form </p>
<p>of a steel tube a dozen feet in diameter. The antenna at Monrovia is </p>
<p>supported by a triangular lattice mast 1157 feet high. The whole </p>
<p>umbrella antenna usually rests on massive porcelain insulators that </p>
<p>are strong enough to support the whole weight plus serious strains </p>
<p>from wind loading, and insulated for a couple of hundred thousand </p>
<p>volts. This is probably the most economical type of antenna to use </p>
<p>when "ready-made" mountain sites are not available, as seldom </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Antennas at Haiku 318</p>
<p>happens in convenient places.</p>
<p>The base-insulated umbrella is the kind of antenna we designed for </p>
<p>the LF Loran stations at the end of World War II. We surely did not </p>
<p>originate the idea, but such antennas were certainly not used very </p>
<p>often before then.</p>
<p>I have only recently learned that a variant of the standard umbrella </p>
<p>configuration is used at the Omega station at La Reunion and perhaps </p>
<p>in Australia. This is the umbrella with the central tower grounded </p>
<p>at the base and insulated at the top from the radial top-loading </p>
<p>cables. A great advantage of this construction is that the tower is </p>
<p>not electrically hot, and it also permits some simplificati.on in </p>
<p>conducting to ground the strokes of lightning that invariably hit </p>
<p>such a tall structure. Because the grounded tower offers a short </p>
<p>capacitive path to ground from the high voltages on the radials </p>
<p>(somewhat like the situation in a valley antenna with too small a </p>
<p>height of parts of the radials) the efficiency is sure to be reduced </p>
<p>in comparison with the same antenna with an insulated base. The </p>
<p>large and expensive porcelain insulator, however, tends to be </p>
<p>mechanically the weakest part of the structure and limits the weight </p>
<p>that can be placed on it. The base-grounded antenna can therefore be </p>
<p>extended to a greater height and thus permit radiation of as much </p>
<p>power as a somewhat lower tower with an insulated base. The tower at </p>
<p>La Reunion, for example, is no less than 1,600 feet tall.</p>
<p>By the time when the first three experimental stations (Hawaii, </p>
<p>Norway, and Trinidad) were operating at two radio frequencies, I had </p>
<p>built a cumbersome mechanical receiver that I hope Harvard has </p>
<p>preserved as part of its collection of ancient instruments. It </p>
<p>measured phases by mechanical resolvers rotated by servomechanisms, </p>
<p>and showed the readings of all three pairs at three frequencies </p>
<p>(including the difference frequency of 3,400 hertz) on mechanical </p>
<p>counters mounted behind a black panel. The readings were </p>
<p>simultaneously recorded at desired intervals by keeping the </p>
<p>counters in a darkened box in front of one of our regular recording </p>
<p>cameras. At the appropriate instants a bright light was flashed on</p>
<p>in the box and recorded the readings of all the counters on a long </p>
<p>roll of bromide photographic paper. This whole mechanism would </p>
<p>greatly astonish a future generation, if it still exists. </p>
<p>From 1967 until my retirement this machine gave excellent service. </p>
<p>It was especially important in giving me readings on the pairs </p>
<p>connecting Norway with the low-latitude stations. The signal from </p>
<p>Norway to Cambridge came across part of the Greenland icecap, which </p>
<p>greatly attenuated the signal, and also for a long distance through </p>
<p>the auroral zone, where bombardment of the upper atmosphere by ions </p>
<p>shot off in solar eruptions at times caused important decreases in </p>
<p>thee time of transmission. In the minds of some people these </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="morelfa">More about Low-Frequency Antennas</b> </a>319</p>
<p>effects, combined with somewhat similar ones caused by solar flares, </p>
<p>threatened to make Omega useless.</p>
<p>A solar flare is a brilliant spot of light that appears at times on </p>
<p>the surface of the sun, generally close to a sunspot group and </p>
<p>consequently more probable in the years when sunspots are at a </p>
<p>maximum. These flares emit intense ultra-violet light and X-rays </p>
<p>that produce ionization at lower heights in the atmosphere than is </p>
<p>usual. This low-level ionization causes strong absorption of energy </p>
<p>from high frequency signals but does not do so at the very low radio </p>
<p>frequencies. In the frequency region of Omega, however, the lowering </p>
<p>of the bottom of the ionized layer makes the carrier-frequency </p>
<p>signals arrive earlier for a time.</p>
<p>A typical solar flare may cause a propagation time to decrease some </p>
<p>ten to twenty or more microseconds in five or ten minutes. The </p>
<p>effect then dies out, usually in an hour or less, but perhaps </p>
<p>lasting two or three hours in the case of an unusually intense </p>
<p>flare. Because the effect is caused by electromagnetic waves it </p>
<p>appears as soon as the flare can be seen and fades away with it. </p>
<p>This SID, or sudden ionospheric disturbance, obviously affects the </p>
<p>entire sunlit hemisphere of the earth, although it is certainly more </p>
<p>troublesome in the sub-solar area in the tropics and in the middle </p>
<p>of the day.</p>
<p>The PCA, or polar cap anomaly, is caused by electrons and other </p>
<p>charged particles. The magnetic field of the earth constrains them </p>
<p>to fall primarily into the regions some 25 to 30 degrees from the </p>
<p>geomagnetic poles. The effects occasionally last as much as ten </p>
<p>days. The PCAs build up rapidly with the arrival of the fastest </p>
<p>particles. Later particles shot off by the sun with less energy, </p>
<p>take longer to arrive and, in effect, keep renewing this unwanted </p>
<p>phenomenon.</p>
<p>My observations of the 3,400 Hz difference frequency promptly showed </p>
<p>me something that I had known in an academic way without really </p>
<p>giving it much thought. I must plead guilty to this fault, although </p>
<p>I suppose it to be common enough. Again and again in my career I </p>
<p>have adopted a course of action (or, perhaps, published a paper) </p>
<p>which would have been greatly improved had I only at the right time </p>
<p>given five minutes more thought to one point or another. I can cite </p>
<p>two or three ways in which the first instrumentation of Loran could </p>
<p>have been improved at the cost of almost no effort at all. In that </p>
<p>case, we had perhaps the excuse of great pressure to produce a </p>
<p>practical device as soon as possible. It has been made clear to me, </p>
<p>in the years since then, that I keep making the same mistake even </p>
<p>when there is no crucial importance to a problem or need to hurry in </p>
<p>its solution. And I have frequently noted the same deficiency in </p>
<p>others. In fact, I have come to believe that nothing is so difficult </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="vagaries">Sources of Some Propagational Vagaries</b> </a>320</p>
<p>as to think one's way clearly and completely through a problem.</p>
<p>In the case of the difference frequency I had noticed, without </p>
<p>thinking about it, that in cases such as the bending of the path of </p>
<p>a radio signal through the ionosphere the phase velocity can exceed </p>
<p>the velocity of light while the group velocity must be less than </p>
<p>that limiting value, as Einstein has taught us. This is implicit in </p>
<p>the basic equations defining the index of refraction in an ionized </p>
<p>medium.</p>
<p>Now if the phase velocity and group velocity (which is the speed </p>
<p>with which energy travels) are not very different, it is a basic </p>
<p>principle that the product of these two velocities equals the square </p>
<p>of the velocity of light. This principle may fail when the phase </p>
<p>velocity gets much above the velocity of light, as it does when </p>
<p>nearing the cutoff frequency in a waveguide or in the space between </p>
<p>the earth and the conducting layers in the upper atmosphere. This </p>
<p>failure is not of much practical importance, however, as the signal </p>
<p>losses become great under such circumstances, as in the 6250'hertz </p>
<p>experiment described above.</p>
<p>It was soon obvious that, when a SID or a PCA caused a sudden </p>
<p>reduction from the normal time of arrival of the carrier </p>
<p>frequencies, the difference frequency signal diverged from the </p>
<p>normal in the opposite sense. It was delayed instead of coming </p>
<p>earlier, as did the carrier frequencies. This was simply a </p>
<p>manifestation of the fact that, the carrier phases that I had been </p>
<p>observing for so long (while thinking of them as time of arrival) </p>
<p>were really only phase phenomena. The difference frequency, like the </p>
<p>signals modulated by pulses in Loran or modulated in any other way, </p>
<p>is quite another matter and travels at the group velocity of the </p>
<p>propagation medium; which is in this case the space between the </p>
<p>earth and the ionized layer.</p>
<p>It took many observations before it came to my full attention that </p>
<p>there was a characteristic difference in the magnitudes of the </p>
<p>propagational anomalies when observed at the two carrier </p>
<p>frequencies, 10.2 and 13.6 kHz. This was, although I had not yet </p>
<p>thought of it in that way, because the 10.2 kHz carrier was </p>
<p>considerably closer to the cutoff frequency of the medtam, which is </p>
<p>near 11 or 5 kHz, so that the departure from the velocity of light </p>
<p>was greater at the lower, of the two frequencies. When enough </p>
<p>experimental data had been collected, it was possible to show that, </p>
<p>on the average, the 13.6 kHz carrier varied only about 5/9 as much </p>
<p>as the 10.2 kHz carrier, and that the 3,400 Hz difference frequency </p>
<p>changed 7/9 as much as did the 10.2 kHz carrier and in the opposite </p>
<p>sense. Some of my slowness in appreciating the importance of these </p>
<p>ratios may have come about because all the deviations from normal </p>
<p>were small, within, about two or three parts in a thousand of the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="composite">Phase or Time? / Composite Signals</b> </a>321</p>
<p>velocity of light. Many of the transient PCAs and SIDs were so small </p>
<p>that accurate measurements were not to be expected; while noise and </p>
<p>instrumental deficiencies caused some distortion of the results.</p>
<p>In any case, at the end of a year I was able to make my first report </p>
<p>on what I called composite signals. This was a technique for roughly </p>
<p>canceling the unfortunate effects of the two kinds of ionospheric </p>
<p>anomalies caused by irregularities in emissions from the sun. It </p>
<p>amounted to suggesting that observations might be made by </p>
<p>subtracting 5/4 of a time difference observed at 13.6 kHz from 9/4 </p>
<p>of the time difference simultaneously observed at 10.2 kHz. This </p>
<p>trick, for which I deduced a theoretical justification, yielded a </p>
<p>composite time difference that seemed to vary only slightly when the </p>
<p>anomalies occurred. It did not do as well at canceling the observed </p>
<p>diurnal variations. The reason was presumably that the new method </p>
<p>corrected for changes in the ionized layer by making the measurement </p>
<p>at what amounted to the velocity of light. This does not eliminate </p>
<p>an effect produced by the associated change in layer height, because </p>
<p>long-distance signals have to travel at something near 3/8 of the </p>
<p>layer height. So when the ionized layer rises at night (a matter of </p>
<p>20 kilometers or so) the signal has to traverse a slightly greater </p>
<p>distance. The remaining diurnal variation when using the composite </p>
<p>signal is indeed smaller, but it is only reduced to about 1/3 of </p>
<p>that at 10.2 kHz or half of that at 13.6 kHz.</p>
<p>There is actually another form of composite signal that can reduce </p>
<p>the diurnal changes to near zero on the average, but with moderately </p>
<p>large changes near sunrise and sunset. This can only be done at the </p>
<p>cost of leaving the propagational anomalies partially uncorrected. </p>
<p>This subject is not worth pursuing here.</p>
<p>I have found the nomenclature and arithmetic of composite signals </p>
<p>convenient in analyzing VLF propagation. I must admit, however, that </p>
<p>the Omega community as a whole has paid little attention to me on </p>
<p>this subject. Even my most reliable correspondent at NEL has never </p>
<p>really admitted that he believes this theory. I am gratified that </p>
<p>Georges Nard, the French expert at SERCEL (Societe d'Etudes </p>
<p>Recherces et Constructions Electroniques), who has done more than </p>
<p>anyone else to make differential Omega practical, uses the composite </p>
<p>method in his receivers. I know of no American manufacturer who does </p>
<p>so but, because most makers do not care to reveal the details of </p>
<p>their trade secrets, I have had almost no information about the </p>
<p>exact techniques used in most Omega receivers.</p>
<p>The idea of differential Omega arises from the fact that there are </p>
<p>diurnal changes in propagation time, the anomalies I have spoken of, </p>
<p>and some temporary variations that prevent exact agreement between </p>
<p>an observed reading and one predicted for that location. There are </p>
<p>problems on the other side of the equation, as well. The calculation </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="DifO">Differential Omega</b> </a>322</p>
<p>of the reading to be expected at a given place is not an exact </p>
<p>science. One can only consult all observational data available and </p>
<p>any theory that may be felt accurate enough to be given weight. The </p>
<p>best that can be done is to compile a relatively simple set of rules </p>
<p>that on the average seem to agree with the theoretical and </p>
<p>observational facts. It would be all too easy to construct a set of </p>
<p>rules for this prediction that contain more errors than the </p>
<p>observations themselves. One must do the best he can to distinguish </p>
<p>the heavily veiled truth and then trust that actual observational </p>
<p>experience will lead to revision of the adopted rules to make them </p>
<p>tend toward perfection.</p>
<p>It leaps to the mind that, when making an approach to a destination, </p>
<p>a navigator could profit by information about what errors are </p>
<p>currently being observed at that point. This is one of very few </p>
<p>aspects of Omega that I have never investigated for myself, but </p>
<p>several friends and acquaintances have done so. Nothing could be </p>
<p>expected if the errors of measurement were themselves as large as </p>
<p>those to be compensated. When, however, the experimenters have taken </p>
<p>care that errors of measurement are small, the method is found to be </p>
<p>helpful over distances up to some hundreds of miles. One of the </p>
<p>happy results of this technique is that the problem of accounting </p>
<p>for diurnal and anomalistic variations may be taken from the </p>
<p>navigator's shoulders as, over moderate distances, these effects </p>
<p>should be much the same at the navigational receiver and at the </p>
<p>monitoring point. Most tests have indicated that the instrumental </p>
<p>error should not be more than two or three percent of the eight-mile </p>
<p>lane width, provided that the best Omega signals have been chosen </p>
<p>for measurement. There is general agreement that the differential </p>
<p>method is hardly worth the trouble of introducing the corrections if </p>
<p>the distance between the receivers is more than 500 miles.</p>
<p>If all navigators were approaching the same destination, it would be </p>
<p>convenient to have a radio station at that location broadcast </p>
<p>continuous reports of the readings observed there. These must, of </p>
<p>course, be measured and reported for each pair (or, preferably, each </p>
<p>station) that is useful in that area. The navigator then might </p>
<p>proceed in such a way that the differences between his own readings. </p>
<p>and those reported to him are reduced to zero, at which time he </p>
<p>should be there.</p>
<p>In general, this is not the best technique. It works better and also </p>
<p>over a wider area to report how much each current reading differs </p>
<p>from the standard prediction for the monitor point. These observed </p>
<p>deviations from charted values (or from computed ones stored in </p>
<p>tables or calculated in the receiver by standard formulae) can be </p>
<p>broadcast in various forms and on different kinds of signals. </p>
<p>Georges Nard manages all this very simply and neatly by adding phase </p>
<p>modulation to transmissions from radio beacon stations that are </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="aircraft">Differential Omega / Omega in Aircraft</b> </a>323</p>
<p>already in existence. The radio beacons themselves transmit </p>
<p>navigational information in the form of continuous signals that </p>
<p>contain information about the direction of a receiver from the </p>
<p>station, or that permit a directional receiver on a vessel to </p>
<p>determine the direction to the station. These beacons, even in the </p>
<p>most satisfactory frequency regions, do not give very useful results </p>
<p>at a distance more than two or three hundred miles, because their </p>
<p>errors are directly proportional to the distance. There are, </p>
<p>therefore, many of these inexpensive transmitters in areas of </p>
<p>interest to navigators except on the high seas.</p>
<p>The SERCEL Omega receiver has an associated receiver for the radio </p>
<p>beacon frequencies. Since the correction signals are coded in the </p>
<p>form of phase, it is easy to add them algebraically to the observed </p>
<p>Omega readings. This is all automatic unless the operator wishes to </p>
<p>disconnect the correction signals. A navigator may often not wish to </p>
<p>do this, however, even when far from land, as the SERCEL Omega </p>
<p>receiver uses, besides the differential correction, the opposite </p>
<p>technique which reduces the diurnal variations to such a degree that </p>
<p>the navigator may not feel the need to bother with the normal </p>
<p>day-to-night adjustments.</p>
<p>By about 1980, SERCEL had a network of some dozen monitoring </p>
<p>stations around the coasts of Europe and Africa, from Denmark to the </p>
<p>Ivory Coast, and throughout the western Mediterranean Sea. They were </p>
<p>also beginning to install a few near the Gulf of St. Lawrence and in </p>
<p>the Caribbean Sea. These stations broadcast signals that are useful </p>
<p>as far as 500 miles. The navigator, of course, chooses the one </p>
<p>nearest to him or to his destination, if the computer in his </p>
<p>receiver does not do so for him.</p>
<p>SERCEL claims an overall accuracy such that 95 percent of the errors </p>
<p>of position are within 0.3 nautical mile at 50 miles from the </p>
<p>differential station and 95 percent within one mile at the 500-mile </p>
<p>distance. I see no reason to doubt these figures.</p>
<p>To use Omega in a fast aircraft requires many special peripheral </p>
<p>devices. It bothers me to remember that we, in the early days, did </p>
<p>not really consider its use except on shipboard. With a ten-second </p>
<p>sampling rate for the signals, a plane flying at 300 knots toward or </p>
<p>away from a station would find the phase of the 10.2 kHz signal </p>
<p>changing by about twenty degrees between samples. As each phase had </p>
<p>to be stored for at least some part of ten seconds for comparison </p>
<p>with another, it was obvious, that a flywheel effect (called the </p>
<p>time constant) had to be used so that each signal would be smoothed </p>
<p>into a moderately steady value. If, as seemed reasonable, this time </p>
<p>constant were to be at least two minutes, our 300-knot airplane </p>
<p>would find its readings lagging about ten miles behind its actual </p>
<p>position. This might possibly be useful, but only on the assumption </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Differential Omega / Omega in Aircraft 324</p>
<p>that aircraft seldom change course and usually do so slowly. If that </p>
<p>hope were valid, simple extrapolation of the observed positions to a </p>
<p>point two minutes ahead might come somewhere near the real position. </p>
<p>Before the age of fast and powerful small computers, we would never </p>
<p>have dared to contemplate the navigation of supersonic aircraft.</p>
<p>Another fundamental difficulty in aircraft is that, at heights where </p>
<p>ice crystals may form, a wire antenna (or any other that responds to </p>
<p>the electric field) is vulnerable to precipitation static that can </p>
<p>drown out most reception at the ordinary radio frequencies. This can </p>
<p>be avoided quite well by using shielded loop antennas that respond </p>
<p>to the magnetic, rather than the electric part of the </p>
<p>electromagnetic field of a signal. It is, nevertheless, always </p>
<p>advisable to use wick dischargers or other devices to help </p>
<p>electrostatic charges leak off from an aircraft in a way that </p>
<p>produces as small magnetic fields as possible at the location of the </p>
<p>loop antenna.</p>
<p>An inherent property of the loop is that, if the plane of the coil </p>
<p>of wire is perpendicular to the direction from which the radio waves </p>
<p>come, the output voltage is zero. This is the fact that makes the </p>
<p>loop valuable for direction finding. It is also true that the phase </p>
<p>of the output current from a loop antenna changes by 180 degrees </p>
<p>depending upon which side of the loop the waves impinge upon. These </p>
<p>characteristics are, for the purpose of general reception, very </p>
<p>inconvenient. The ordinary solution is to use two loops that are </p>
<p>physically at right angles, so that if the signal is weak in one it </p>
<p>must be strong in the other. The phase of the signal, which is what </p>
<p>we wish to measure in Omega, thus depends upon which side of which </p>
<p>loop is presented to the radio wave. A convenient way to combine the </p>
<p>currents from both loops is to couple them together with 45-degree </p>
<p>phase-shifting circuits. This produces an output signal with an </p>
<p>amplitude that does not change with direction, but whose phase will </p>
<p>change by 360 degrees if the aircraft turns in a circle. In an Omega </p>
<p>receiver, the signal would gain or lose a cycle in such a turn, </p>
<p>depending upon whether the turn were to the right or left. This </p>
<p>would be intolerable unless something were done about it.</p>
<p>The computer is easily able to solve these problems. By connecting </p>
<p>to it inputs from the aircraft's course and speed indicators, the </p>
<p>computer calculates the direction of each station with respect to </p>
<p>the heading of the plane, and makes a correction for the rotating </p>
<p>phase of the signal. This set of directions to the various stations </p>
<p>is also converted into directions to the stations from the most </p>
<p>probable position of the aircraft, which may be no more than the </p>
<p>last measured position. Artificial signals are generated in the </p>
<p>receiver, and these are corrected for each station so as to adjust </p>
<p>for the direction and speed of the aircraft. The actual measurement </p>
<p>of the incoming phases is made with respect to the aircraft standard </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="mactaggart">Loop Antennas / Mactaggart</b> </a>325</p>
<p>after these individual adjustments for each station. All signals are </p>
<p>thus made to stand still, or at least move more slowly, to permit </p>
<p>accurate measurement. As the errors of dead reckoning in an aircraft </p>
<p>do not often accumulate at more than a fifteen-knot speed, the </p>
<p>overall result is to make the Omega receiver "believe" that it is at </p>
<p>rest, or at worst moving no faster than a ship. </p>
<p>I may have understood many of these facts to a minor degree, but </p>
<p>they were made real to me by a number of conversations with Donald </p>
<p>Mactaggart. Don was a bright young engineer with the Canadian </p>
<p>Marconi Company who wished to build a fully modern Omega receiver. </p>
<p>For some reason he chose to come for advice to the Implementation </p>
<p>Committee, or at least to Dick Woodward and me, rather than to get </p>
<p>specifications and help from the Navy, as did most American </p>
<p>companies. After several discussions, he went back to Montreal and </p>
<p>designed the correct equipment and constructed a computer algorithm </p>
<p>that has not yet needed to be amended -- a mathematical triumph </p>
<p>indeed.</p>
<p>It may be that the receiver made by Canadian Marconi performs no </p>
<p>better than some of its American competitors, but it certainly had </p>
<p>an expert demonstrator and salesman in Don. The positional output </p>
<p>was designed to be similar to that from an inertial navigation </p>
<p>instrument. A single switch allows two counters to display the </p>
<p>latitude and longitude, or true course and speed, or the direction </p>
<p>and time-to-go to any of a set of pre-chosen way points, or even </p>
<p>(after subtracting out all of the better-known variables) the </p>
<p>direction, and speed of the wind! All this, from a box that occupied </p>
<p>perhaps half a cubic foot, amazed me. Don flew a company airplane </p>
<p>anywhere he could find a potential customer and gave elegant </p>
<p>demonstrations. I especially remember his description of a trial for </p>
<p>the chief navigator of Pan American Airlines, a man whom I had met </p>
<p>at a meeting in Munich in 1965, and who then had had almost zero </p>
<p>interest in the idea of Omega.</p>
<p>Don set up this demonstration in a very pretty way. He inserted, as </p>
<p>waypoints, the latitudes and longitudes of a dozen or more small </p>
<p>islands, or lighthouses, or other places that could be easily </p>
<p>identified on a flight throughout the Bahamas and part of the </p>
<p>Caribbean Sea. As each one was passed, he would have the plane </p>
<p>follow the indicated course to the next waypoint and set the switch </p>
<p>to read the time-to-go for that place. As that indication approached </p>
<p>zero, Don would be sure that the Pan American chief navigator looked </p>
<p>down to see the expected point below. This could hardly fail to be </p>
<p>convincing when no attention had been paid to the aircraft's own </p>
<p>indicators of speed and direction.</p>
<p>It is not strange that Pan American became the first major airline </p>
<p>to install Omega as a routine navigational aid. It was a surprise to </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="data">A Few Flight Data</b> </a>326</p>
<p>me, however, when some years later Don told me that the Russians had </p>
<p>become the Marconi Company's second largest customer.</p>
<p>I was pleased by a reporter's detailed account of a round-trip </p>
<p>flight from New York to Monrovia that was printed in a technical </p>
<p>magazine in early 1979. This gave me some longed-for data about the </p>
<p>accuracy actually achieved in service, and also some idea of the </p>
<p>precision of our old bug-bear, inertial navigation. On this flight </p>
<p>two separate Omega receivers were compared with a single inertial </p>
<p>navigation device and with positions determined by overflights of </p>
<p>known places. Both flights were made overnight, between ten o'clock </p>
<p>at night and eight AM, Greenwich Time, (with an hour's stop at </p>
<p>Dakar) on the outward trip; and between nine PM and six in the </p>
<p>morning on the non-stop return flight. Omega accuracy is commonly </p>
<p>supposed to be only half as good at night as by day. Accurate </p>
<p>positions were known at New York, Nantucket, and at three points </p>
<p>along the African coast. The positions indicated by the two Omega </p>
<p>receivers differed from each other, on the average, by less than </p>
<p>half a mile. For the whole round trip, all Omega positions from both </p>
<p>receivers differed from ground truth by an average of 1.11 nautical </p>
<p>miles, with a maximum error of 2.1 miles at Dakar. These numbers, </p>
<p>although reporting only twenty independent measurements, may be </p>
<p>compared with the Coast Guard's estimate of Omega accuracy, which is </p>
<p>95 percent of all readings within four miles at night.</p>
<p>In a malicious way, I was pleased that, after showing an error of </p>
<p>1.2 miles at Nantucket on the outward trip, the inertial navigator </p>
<p>failed to perform properly. On the return trip, the inertial </p>
<p>navigator recovered its poise. It showed errors of 0.8 and 1.3 miles </p>
<p>at the two known points in Africa (after leaving Monrovia), and </p>
<p>errors of 7.3 and 6.8 miles at Nantucket and New York.</p>
<p>I was recently greatly pleased to hear on good authority that Omege </p>
<p>was the only navigational aid used on the first non-stop flight </p>
<p>around the world by the famous Voyager aircraft.</p>
<p>I might have mentioned earlier that, aside from doubts of phase </p>
<p>stability, the implementation cC Omega was delayed by three factors: </p>
<p>(1) competition by inertial navigation, (2) the same by navigation </p>
<p>by satellites, and (3) by fear of hydrogen bombs.</p>
<p>The first of these was very natural. The guidance of missiles and </p>
<p>satellites had brought inertial navigation forward in long strides. </p>
<p>Before the time of a meeting in Munich in 1965, inertial methods for </p>
<p>aircraft navigation had been refined and improved to a degree </p>
<p>surprising to me. At that meeting, the hero of the occasion was </p>
<p>Professor Charles Stark Draper of MIT, to whom most of the inertial </p>
<p>credit belonged. The three Omega papers at the meeting were listened </p>
<p>to politely, but it was clear that most people thought that the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="challenger">The "Challenger" Flight / Various Delays</b> </a>327</p>
<p>future belonged to inertial navigation.</p>
<p>Overlapping the belief in inertial to some extent was a school of </p>
<p>thought that believed that all future navigation would be done </p>
<p>through satellites. This era had begun, soon after the first </p>
<p>artificial satellite, in the form of Transit, a system that depends </p>
<p>upon study of the Doppler shifts in a signal from a satellite in a </p>
<p>known orbit. This is the exact inverse of the observations of the </p>
<p>Marconi Company that I had admired in England in 1957. The accuracy </p>
<p>was later improved by a change to time-of-arrival methods and is now </p>
<p>reaching a (perhaps final) state in what is known as GPS, or Global </p>
<p>Positioning System. When it achieves its full twenty-four </p>
<p>satellites, GPS promises to give worldwide position, including </p>
<p>height, with a precision of ten meters or better for military </p>
<p>purposes. It is, of course, forbiddingly expensive, and the </p>
<p>military, under great pressure, have only agreed to let it be used </p>
<p>for civil purposes in a degraded form, perhaps accurate enough for </p>
<p>most navigation while still with enough errors to discourage use by </p>
<p>an enemy! In this case, I could agree with a theory which I scouted </p>
<p>in the case of Omega, as will be mentioned below: that if sole </p>
<p>reliance were placed on GPS a declaration of war might take the form </p>
<p>of the disappearance of the navigational satellites.</p>
<p>I actually served for a year on a NASA committee working toward this </p>
<p>end, but was dismissed (under the pretext that I had asked to be </p>
<p>relieved for reasons of health) in some ignominy as I declined to </p>
<p>believe that all other navigational efforts of the government should </p>
<p>be discontinued. In any event, faith in the future of some yet-to-</p>
<p>be-named satellite method caused more delay in getting approval for </p>
<p>Omega.</p>
<p>The third obstacle was what seemed to me an obvious attempt to </p>
<p>frighten governments contemplating the installation of Omega </p>
<p>stations. This appeared first in Norway, as far back as the first </p>
<p>installation of an experimental station there. The stories </p>
<p>circulated in newspapers and magazines claimed that the Omega effort </p>
<p>was in support of the Polaris missile development (quite untrue) and </p>
<p>that such a station would be the first thing attacked in case of </p>
<p>nuclear war. The Norwegian government paid little attention to these </p>
<p>stories, apparently in the belief that the Omega system would be of </p>
<p>great help to its commercial shipping and fishing interests. </p>
<p>The only place that I seriously felt should be the site of an Omega </p>
<p>station was at the extreme southern end of New Zealand, preferably </p>
<p>as far as possible into the offshore islands. This would counter a </p>
<p>distressing tendency for the sites chosen for stations to creep </p>
<p>northward and unbalance the overall geometrical pattern. I was much </p>
<p>surprised to find that the exact same arguments as in Norway </p>
<p>appeared in the New Zealand press, and on the radio. I was lucky </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="political">Political Interference</b> </a>328</p>
<p>enough to be asked for comments on this matter by a New Zealand </p>
<p>reporter who had become interested in refuting these ideas. I am </p>
<p>still happy to have a small file of letters from him. He was able to </p>
<p>show, not only the identity of the arguments with those in Norway, </p>
<p>but in many cases the use of the same paragraphs in the news </p>
<p>stories. I do not know how much influence these may have had, but </p>
<p>the New Zealand government refused to allow Omega a site in that </p>
<p>country. I hope that this contretemps was not the source of the </p>
<p>anti-nuclear distrust that has now excluded American warships from </p>
<p>New Zealand harbors and broken the ANZUS alliance.</p>
<p>After long delays, the Australian government gave Omega a home </p>
<p>there, but for many years the unnecessary Trinidad station was kept </p>
<p>in operation while there were more delays in the choice of a site </p>
<p>and in completing construction in Australia. It was, as I perhaps </p>
<p>mentioned earlier, only in August, 1982, that the Omega transmitting </p>
<p>network was finished. Omega had had to survive even one era when </p>
<p>Australia was determined to put the station in an area to which the </p>
<p>government wished to attract tourists! Fortunately, the final </p>
<p>decision was to put it where it should be; as close as was practical </p>
<p>to the New Zealand area.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>In the end, the success of Omega had one unpleasant effect for me. </p>
<p>For a dozen years, the Bureau of Ships had added occasional sums to </p>
<p>the grants through the Office of Naval Research (including equal </p>
<p>contributions by the Army and Air Force) that supported a large part </p>
<p>of my work at Harvard. In about 1968 the Omega Project Office of the </p>
<p>Navy, which had taken over management of Omega from the Bureau of </p>
<p>Ships when action was taken to build the system, decided that </p>
<p>research was no longer needed. To this end, its contributions to </p>
<p>Harvard were no longer made, although the research agencies of the </p>
<p>three military services continued their faithful support. This </p>
<p>considerably curtailed the research funds available to me and, as </p>
<p>costs were continually rising, caused a gradual decrease in my staff </p>
<p>that continued until my retirement a half dozen years later.</p>
</font><p><hr>
<font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="disappointments"></a></p>
<p>I have mentioned one or two of the ways in which the Navy, the only </p>
<p>government service willing to support the Omega effort, failed to </p>
<p>adopt the recommendations of the Implementation Committee. I did </p>
<p>not, for example, worry much about the delayed decision to use the </p>
<p>side frequencies, or to the change in the choice of frequencies when </p>
<p>they were actually radiated. Also, I am by no means sure that the </p>
<p>Omega stations have ever used the full complement of four cesium </p>
<p>frequency standards we wished for but experience has shown that the </p>
<p>signal reliability is very satisfactory in any case. It is also true </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p>Other Personal Disappointments</b> 329</p>
<p>that I have evidence that the precision of signal synchronization is </p>
<p>less than it should be even though direct interstation comunication </p>
<p>probably has not been installed.</p>
<p>I find it more serious that Omega has never been equipped for </p>
<p>continuous signal emission. It disturbs me to hear that the various </p>
<p>stations are shut down, one at a time, for some weeks for annual </p>
<p>maintenance. I feel that probably one or two extra stations might </p>
<p>well have been added to our choice of the number eight. There is </p>
<p>some evidence that the service is thin in a few areas at some times </p>
<p>in the day and year. This deficiency must be greatly exaggerated </p>
<p>when an operating station is shut down for maintenance, which </p>
<p>happens in one of eight selected months for one station or another.</p>
<p>To me, the most disappointing omission is the other frequencies that </p>
<p>we proposed should be emitted in the form of phase modulation. These </p>
<p>transmissions, expensive as they might have been, would have </p>
<p>provided the kind of unattended position finding most critically </p>
<p>required for search and rescue purposes. In recent years a fourth </p>
<p>frequency has been added that resolves ambiguity to 288 nautical </p>
<p>miles, nominally. It is hoped that this distance can be extended, </p>
<p>effectively to infinity, by measurement of the times of arrival of </p>
<p>the various bursts of signal. Such measurement would have to be </p>
<p>accurate to a few milliseconds of time. Many years ago, when the </p>
<p>low-frequency Naval station in the Panama Canal zone was </p>
<p>transmitting a short burst of signal each second as a method of time </p>
<p>distribution, I made some studies of the precision I could achieve </p>
<p>by measurement of the time of arrival. I found a standard deviation </p>
<p>of about half a millisecond, but only with a very strong signal, a </p>
<p>"pulse" each second, and a very long integration time.</p>
<p>Today's techniques are no doubt more accurate, but bursts of much </p>
<p>weaker signals come only each ten seconds (unless they are made on </p>
<p>each of the four transmitted frequencies) and useful integration </p>
<p>times should be no more than a very few minutes. It appears to me </p>
<p>that this technique may be hard to use to gain the necessary </p>
<p>precision. I have read no papers that disclose results from such a </p>
<p>method and have not heard that it has been successfully tested.</p>
<p>In the last year before my retirement there was a very interesting </p>
<p>effort to reduce to practice a search and rescue system under the </p>
<p>name GRAN, or the Global Rescue Alarm Network. This proposed that </p>
<p>the phases of all Omega signals should be retransmitted in the form </p>
<p>of modulation on a signal of 400 to 500 mHz, that would be relayed </p>
<p>to a shore-based station through a geostationary satellite. Position </p>
<p>of a vehicle or man in distress could thus be determined on shore </p>
<p>and transmitted to a rescue vessel.</p>
<p>This project was, for a short time, carried forward by a small group </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other Personal Disappointments 330</p>
<p>operating with support from the Navy, the Coast Guard, and NASA. At </p>
<p>the time I first heard of their work they had demonstrated </p>
<p>successful relaying of Omega signals by satellite with little more </p>
<p>than the power of a flashlight and with no requirement for a </p>
<p>directional antenna. The leaders of the work came to me for ideas </p>
<p>about extending the range of ambiguity resolution. I suggested the </p>
<p>addition of a fourth frequency at 10880 kHz which offered resolution </p>
<p>to a nominal 360 nautical wiles. Further resolution was loosely </p>
<p>suggested through the use of signals from more than the required </p>
<p>three stations, or through the pulse-timing idea described above, or </p>
<p>both.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1973, such signals at four frequencies were received </p>
<p>in Texas from the experimental stations at Forestport (New York) and </p>
<p>Trinidad. The measurements were brought to me to be put through the </p>
<p>lane identification process. The results, to me, were quite </p>
<p>satisfactory although in the middle of the night there were many </p>
<p>instances of failure of the identification of the 10.2 kHz cycle. </p>
<p>The lower frequency identifications were entirely satisfactory. I </p>
<p>attribute this difficulty in part to the rather short distance from </p>
<p>ForestPort (about 1300 nautical miles) but primarily to the fact </p>
<p>that only approximate calculations of the expected phases were </p>
<p>available. These measurements were made on only four nights in </p>
<p>October and five in November. I was at that time busy developing a </p>
<p>correction method, based upon intercomparisons at different </p>
<p>frequencies, that made it possible to correct, to some extent, </p>
<p>observed data for errors in prediction. This technique enabled me to </p>
<p>dispose of the night-time errors except for a few cases.</p>
<p>Perhaps my report of these difficulties discouraged the </p>
<p>experimenters, or perhaps (as rumor suggested) there was some </p>
<p>administrative difference of opinion about assessing the costs of </p>
<p>the experiment to the three governmental departments involved. In </p>
<p>any case, my visitors suddenly stopped coming to see me and the </p>
<p>project apparently collapsed.</p>
<p>I greatly regretted this, and hope that the work may some day be </p>
<p>revived under happier auspice; as the Omega signal offers unusual </p>
<p>opportunities for such signal relaying in a very narrow bandwidth. I </p>
<p>had really felt great interest, and confidence, in the idea that an </p>
<p>inexpensive piece of gear could be operated hand-held in a lifeboat </p>
<p>(or could float free in case of the sinking of a ship or aircraft) </p>
<p>and would call a rescuer promptly to the scene of an accident.</p>

<p>My most distressing experience, in respect to Omega, was to find </p>
<p>that upon my retirement all communications from the Navy and Coast </p>
<p>Guard (which had assumed operating control of the Omega system) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p>The Proposed Global Rescue Alarm</b> 331</p>
<p>ceased at once. I could only assume that no one wished any </p>
<p>experimenting to continue that might contribute new ideas to </p>
<p>complicate the lives of those charged with constructing and </p>
<p>maintaining an operating system. I have mentioned above the </p>
<p>unfortunate results (for Germany) that followed upon Hitler's </p>
<p>abandonment of scientific research after 1939, so I will decline the </p>
<p>opportunity to repeat that lecture here.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>I am still pleased that none of my efforts to aid navigation earned </p>
<p>me any money directly. Both at MIT and at Harvard, all funds were </p>
<p>granted to the institution which then paid me whatever it was felt </p>
<p>that I deserved. In both cases it is likely that my success at what </p>
<p>I was doing caused some increases in salary, but I have always been </p>
<p>able to enjoy the happy feeling that I was the perfect amateur, </p>
<p>doing what I felt was right in the national interest without thought </p>
<p>of personal gain. I did, as a matter of fact, refuse many offers of </p>
<p>a consulting agreement, as I usually felt that what was wanted was </p>
<p>not my expertise but the use of my name. It is also true that I </p>
<p>greatly enjoyed my resulting freedom to criticize anyone or any </p>
<p>institution!</p>
<p>There are other aspects of my doings in connection with Omega that </p>
<p>may appear in later chapters. If I had thought things through from </p>
<p>the beginning of these memoirs, I would have tried to maintain </p>
<p>better separation between my technical affairs and the personal </p>
<p>stories that must be more likely to interest others. I shall, to try </p>
<p>to restore the balance a little, close this chapter and devote </p>
<p>whatever else may be found in these pages to matters much more </p>
<p>likely to please my family or others. </p>

<b><p><a name="sometravels">Some Travels in 1965, 1966, and 1967</a></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February, 1965, a civilian administrator in the Omega Project </p>
<p>Office and I flew to Trinidad to inspect the site of the Hemisphere </p>
<p>Radio station mentioned in the last chapter. The place was still </p>
<p>under the control of the U. S. Navy, as a part of the base that </p>
<p>continued to be maintained there.</p>
<p>Our first surprise was to find that no plane reservations could be </p>
<p>made to Trinidad for a week or more and that no hotel rooms would be </p>
<p>available if we could get there. We had accidentally chosen to go at </p>
<p>the time of Carnival, just before the beginning of Lent. When we did </p>
<p>get to the island and learn more about that festival, we agreed that </p>
<p>it was essential to time any future visit more carefully, as will </p>
<p>appear below.</p>
<p>I had at that time no passport that had not lapsed. At the Pan </p>
<p>American desk at Kennedy Airport I was surprised and somewhat amused </p>
<p>to find that an old Army ID card, probably issued in connection with </p>
<p>the traveling I had done for the Research and Development Board </p>
<p>seventeen years earlier, was the only identification that the </p>
<p>airline was sure would permit my return to the United States. It did </p>
<p>work perfectly, when needed.</p>
<p>In Trinidad, Rex Stout, the Project Office representative, and I </p>
<p>were driven to the naval base at Chaguaramas, in the northwest </p>
<p>corner of the island, where a beautiful site gave an overview of the </p>
<p>small islands dotting the Dragon's Mouth, the western passage </p>
<p>between Trinidad and Venezuela. This was the same strait where our </p>
<p>Pan Am clipper had had such trouble taking off in 1944. We were </p>
<p>assigned rooms in the bachelor officers' quarters, which had been an </p>
<p>old millionaire's mansion before the base was leased to the Navy. </p>
<p>The large and airy house had two wings extending forward to enclose </p>
<p>a well-kept garden with many handsome tropical trees in blossom. </p>
<p>This area was inhabited by a gorgeous scarlet macaw, fully three </p>
<p>feet long, who was always to be seen in the garden or perched </p>
<p>somewhere in the colonnade that overlooked it. We were told that he </p>
<p>had flown over from Venezuela some twenty years before and had </p>
<p>stayed on that property ever since.</p>
<p>When we were taken to see the old wartime, or really postwar, </p>
<p>transmitter building, I made my first close acquaintance with the </p>
<p>tropical jungle. The valley over which the antenna had hung, and </p>
<p>which was proposed for the same use again, had an area of a square </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>333</p>
<p>mile or more. A track used for occasional inspection by jeep had </p>
<p>been kept hacked through the growth of twenty years since the whole </p>
<p>area had been cleared. We could therefore be driven to the building, </p>
<p>which was among the most substantial I have seen. It was of </p>
<p>reinforced concrete with a bomb-proof flat roof five or six feet </p>
<p>thick and with walls to correspond. My hesitation, above, in calling </p>
<p>this a wartime building is because, in a common military fashion, </p>
<p>the station had operated throughout the war but the bomb-proof </p>
<p>building was not finished until after war had ended.</p>
<p>There were no windows in the building, but it had three or four </p>
<p>openings a few inches high just beneath the roof, or ceiling. These </p>
<p>had admitted a colony of surely ten thousand or more bats. The </p>
<p>interior was filled with them, their sounds and their smells. In </p>
<p>what little light there was, I could admire the dexterity with which </p>
<p>a bat could fly along, just under the ceiling, and suddenly invert </p>
<p>himself to seize an inconspicuous roughness to suspend himself on, </p>
<p>upside down of course. The performance of this feat had to be quick, </p>
<p>as there were few empty spots and always hundreds of bats looking </p>
<p>for a landing place. It was barely conceivable that this barren and </p>
<p>stinking cave could be made into a suitable building for a </p>
<p>transmitter.</p>
<p>This site was near the bottom of a valley between ridges nine </p>
<p>hundred or a thousand feet above the valley floor. There was a </p>
<p>cement perimeter a dozen feet wide surrounding the building and </p>
<p>holding the jungle at bay at that distance. I had seen a plan of the </p>
<p>area and knew that there was a small gully a few yards away from the </p>
<p>building. As I wished to see how much of an obstacle this might be </p>
<p>to laying a good wire ground screen, I started from the edge of the </p>
<p>cement to go see as much as I could.</p>
<p>The growth of vegetation was amazing. I cannot say how much was </p>
<p>trees and how much vines, many two to three inches in diameter. The </p>
<p>entangled canopy extended to a height of thirty feet or so. I went </p>
<p>to the edge of the cement, forced the vines apart until I could take </p>
<p>one step into the jungle. As I tried to clear the way for a second </p>
<p>step, I realized that it would certainly take me all morning to </p>
<p>reach the little gully, and retreated to the edge of the cement.</p>
<p>I was much interested to learn that the proposed clearing of this </p>
<p>square mile of difficult terrain, for the installation of the ground </p>
<p>system, would be done in the old-fashioned way by a myriad of </p>
<p>workers with machetes. I suspect that the growth was so intertwined </p>
<p>as to entangle even a bulldozer, but possibly the choice was simply </p>
<p>a matter of utilizing a cheap labor force.</p>
<p>I made some calculations, on the spot, of the power that could be </p>
<p>radiated from an antenna covering most of the valley. I found that </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="bats">Bats / The Tropical Jungle</b> </a>334</p>
<p>the required power for Omega could not be reached without putting a </p>
<p>row of towers four or five hundred feet high along the crests of the </p>
<p>ridges to raise the height of the antenna. The valley was simply too </p>
<p>small. The cost of so many towers, sturdy enough to hold the heavy </p>
<p>cables under great tension, seemed to me excessive. I recommended </p>
<p>that Trinidad should not be adopted for a station, unless such </p>
<p>towers could be used. As so often happened, the Navy paid no </p>
<p>attention to this suggestion and built a station there anyway. A </p>
<p>year later I was to have the surprise of seeing the same building, </p>
<p>now tile-lined and air-conditioned, with a fine transmitter </p>
<p>installed where in 1965 the bats had lived and multiplied in peace.</p>
<p>The view from the top of the transmitter building was impressive. </p>
<p>The whole valley was a rich and quite uniform green. A half mile or </p>
<p>more away there were three or four green fountains extending above </p>
<p>the general level of the jungle, where the green climbed up and fell </p>
<p>back in festoons. These were the rusted remains of lattice radio </p>
<p>towers a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet tall. In one case, the </p>
<p>cross-bracing could be detected among the vines after the existence </p>
<p>of the towers had been called to our attention.</p>
<p>The base commander lent us his little seaplane to fly over the site. </p>
<p>I was greatly impressed to find that, even from a low altitude, one </p>
<p>could not distinguish any difference between the jungle where a </p>
<p>clearing had been only twenty years before and the original jungle </p>
<p>that surrounded it. This was my most impressive demonstration of the </p>
<p>power of nature in replacing or covering the works of man, even </p>
<p>though I had known that some of the woods I had roamed in as a boy </p>
<p>had been cleared fields a century earlier.</p>
<p>When I left Trinidad to come home, it was convenient to stay </p>
<p>overnight in a hotel in Port of Spain while waiting for a morning </p>
<p>plane. I spent part of the evening sitting beside the hotel's </p>
<p>swimming pool and watching a small bat drinking from it. The bat </p>
<p>flew, for half an hour or so, in an ellipse almost the size of the </p>
<p>pool. As he (or she) came by near me on each circuit, he would </p>
<p>descend from a height of four or five feet to almost zero, drop his </p>
<p>lower jaw, and apparently take up a few drops of water, much as the </p>
<p>old steam trains scooped up water from troughs between the rails. </p>
<p>The bat could not have caught much at each trip, because it </p>
<p>continued this activity for so long. It occurred to me that the </p>
<p>intent might have been to pick up insects, but the pattern was so </p>
<p>uniform, always going down to the surface at nearly the same place </p>
<p>in the pool, that I felt quite sure that water was the objective. </p>

<p>The Navy asked me to give one of three papers about Omega at a </p>
<p>meeting of an international association of Institutes of Navigation </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p>Another Bat / Munich</b> 335</p>
<p>in Munich in August. I prepared a paper on the general idea of </p>
<p>hyperbolic navigation at very low radio frequencies, with special </p>
<p>emphasis on the trigonometrical features that operate so strongly to </p>
<p>limit the dilution of accuracy when using very long baselines. The </p>
<p>other two papers were given by friends from NEL and NRL. They dealt </p>
<p>more with practical matters and the results of experience.</p>
<p>This time I managed to avoid the pain associated with using military </p>
<p>transportation and flew to England by commercial airline. I did not </p>
<p>have much time there, but did pay calls in or near London upon </p>
<p>acquaintances and correspondents. I flew, one evening, to Munich on </p>
<p>a plane of the British European Airline, which stopped at Frankfurt </p>
<p>for immigrations and customs examination. This was the simplest and </p>
<p>shortest, not to say most farcical, border crossing I ever </p>
<p>experienced. We were herded off the plane, without our bags, and </p>
<p>into the immigration area. When my turn came I extended my passport </p>
<p>to a suave and polished gentleman of about sixty years. He smiled </p>
<p>gently, took the document by a corner between thumb and finger and, </p>
<p>without opening it, handed it back. I did my best to return his </p>
<p>courteous bow and passed on into the customs area. This was </p>
<p>completely empty of both bags and officials. With nothing else to </p>
<p>do, we all got back onto the plane and proceeded to Munich.</p>
<p>I had long realized that the one year of German I had foolishly </p>
<p>taken had done me little good. I was quite sure of it when I could </p>
<p>barely direct the taxi to my hotel. But a few days later I was </p>
<p>cheered to discover that I was beginning to understand a few words, </p>
<p>here and there.</p>
<p>This deficiency did not matter, as the meeting was prepared to deal </p>
<p>with several languages. It was held at IKOFA, a park-like area with </p>
<p>many varied exhibition halls and meeting places. The room for our </p>
<p>meetings was the first I encountered with full translation </p>
<p>facilities. A wire antenna looped around the room radiated </p>
<p>translations of all the papers and discussions in a half-dozen </p>
<p>languages. We could turn the selector on a box connected to our </p>
<p>headphones and amuse ourselves by trying to decide whether the </p>
<p>speaker in Spanish were getting ahead of the one in French, for </p>
<p>example. All our papers had been sent ahead for translation in </p>
<p>advance, but the translators also handled the discussions with what </p>
<p>seemed equal ease and accuracy. My paper was the first and only one </p>
<p>of mine that I know to have been printed in both French and German </p>
<p>and, if I was told truthfully, in Russian.</p>
<p>The meeting went on for several days, and covered some aspects of </p>
<p>navigation that were not of much interest to me. There was, of </p>
<p>course, plenty of time to see some of Munich and its uninhibited </p>
<p>night life. I recall one night club where I ate the most delicate </p>
<p>and delicious schnitzel I ever had. There were seven or eight of us </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="meeting">The Meeting in Munich</b> </a>336</p>
<p>crowded around a circular table with a sort of pedestal in the </p>
<p>center. This turned out to be the resting place for a good-sized keg </p>
<p>of beer which we drew upon at will. The show was presumably very </p>
<p>funny and was greatly appreciated by the large and vociferous crowd. </p>
<p>About the only bit I understood was when the ardent swain's trousers </p>
<p>fell down in the presence of the mayor. This was clear in any </p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>On our most formal evening we were invited to an abendessen in </p>
<p>Ratskeller zu Rathaus, or a dinner in the Council's dining room in </p>
<p>the cellar of the city hall. Several of us went to this function in </p>
<p>what was probably the fastest taxi ride I ever took. I sat in front </p>
<p>with the driver and, to keep from seeing the way in which we hurtled </p>
<p>through traffic in the heart of the city, watched the speedometer </p>
<p>hovering between 100 and 110 km/hr most of the time.</p>
<p>The dinner itself was notable for well-arranged seating so that each </p>
<p>of us had reasonable exposure to some of the dignitaries of the host </p>
<p>association and of the city and state, as well as an assortment of </p>
<p>our co-workers in other countries. My chief memory is of the </p>
<p>meticulous care with which one of the hosts explained (while.the </p>
<p>waiters carried out) the tradition that in Munich one does not allow </p>
<p>a guest's beer glass to become empty. Mine, I noticed, seemed to be </p>
<p>replaced each time the level got down to about a half. This occasion </p>
<p>was my one and only experience in drinking toasts in beer. </p>
<p>On another occasion we drank at the Hofbrauhaus, the beer-hall that </p>
<p>became notorious as Hitler's early meeting place. By Munich's </p>
<p>standards I suppose it was relatively small, seating two or three </p>
<p>thousand people. The sight and sound of so many Germans all singing </p>
<p>and enjoying themselves was interesting in itself. I understand that </p>
<p>some of the brewing companies' tents, that are set up for the </p>
<p>Octoberfest, seat as many as twenty thousand.</p>
<p>Our meetings must have extended through parts of two weeks, as I had </p>
<p>pleasant experiences during the weekend. On the Saturday I spent the </p>
<p>day alone at the Deutschesmuseum, possibly the finest scientific and </p>
<p>technical museum in the world. I happened to start by going down </p>
<p>into a mining exhibit dug far into the ground below the museum. I </p>
<p>think it included at least iron, coal, and gold mining. .1 wandered </p>
<p>from place to place underground, through shafts, corridors and </p>
<p>galleries, with models of all operations at full scale. I began to </p>
<p>wonder whether I would ever come to the surface again, but I did so </p>
<p>after nearly two hours.</p>
<p>The transportation exhibits were magnificent, extending even to </p>
<p>fairly large trading ships of various eras. My favorite in this </p>
<p>section was a canoe like Hiawatha's, with the delightful label </p>
<p>BIRKENRINDENKANU. I still quote this occasionally as an example of </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="oberammergau">Munich and Oberammergau</b> </a>337</p>
<p>the way the German language frightens one off by running three or </p>
<p>four English words into one. Until one learns to take such a </p>
<p>compound word apart, this style can cause great confusion. Another </p>
<p>remarkable exhibit was the chassis and engine of the automobile </p>
<p>which won the improbable race around the world from New York to </p>
<p>Paris in 1908. I do not think that this grandfather of all long-</p>
<p>distance races went through Alaska, as in the movie farce The Great </p>
<p>Race, but it did involve the long overland run from Vladivostok to </p>
<p>Paris in the days before filling stations, and took several months.</p>
<p>If I remember rightly, it started in February, the winning car </p>
<p>arrived in Paris in June, and the second place car in September. In </p>
<p>its exhibited form, the car has had ninety-degree sectors cut out of </p>
<p>the cases of the gear box and differential, so that the strength and </p>
<p>elegance of the gears can be seen. It was one of the finest pieces </p>
<p>of machinery I ever expect to see, and kept me fascinated for a long </p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>The exhibit that most pleased and impressed me was a room full of </p>
<p>Heinrich Hertz's original experimental gear, with which he </p>
<p>demonstrated the fact that radio waves are simply light waves with a </p>
<p>far greater wavelength. The museum seemed to have all of his plane </p>
<p>and parabolic mirrors (made of wires) and prisms (made of pitch). </p>
<p>How he accomplished all he did continues to amaze me, as his only </p>
<p>deteption mechanism was to look for tiny sparks with a magnifying </p>
<p>glass. To be sure, he had James Clerk Maxwell's electromagnetic </p>
<p>theory to guide him but, as a brilliant experimenter, he must have </p>
<p>regarded the theory with at least a degree of skepticism. </p>
<p>I had entered the Deutschesmuseum when it opened in the morning and </p>
<p>left it only when dinner time approached. It was a happy, tiring, </p>
<p>and fruitful day for me. </p>
<p>On the next day I became the complete tourist, and took a bus trip </p>
<p>to Oberammergau. I was drawn to this, while my Omega friends went to </p>
<p>Salzburg, because I remembered Grandma telling me about how she and </p>
<p>Grandpa had gone there for the Passion Play in 1910. Our tour went </p>
<p>through the beautiful alpine scenery of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, the </p>
<p>ski resort used for the winter Olympics in 1936. </p>
<p>I knew that the Germans tend to worship the memory of Goethe. I was, </p>
<p>nonetheless surprised by the reverence displayed by the tour guide </p>
<p>when, in a town whose name I forget, he pointed out a bronze plate </p>
<p>on the front of a small restaurant, which commemorated the fact that </p>
<p>on a day in 1771 Goethe had had lunch there! </p>
<p>My own lunch, also in a town I do not remember, was called a </p>
<p>bauernomelett. It must have taken four eggs to bind together the </p>
<p>liter or more of potatoes, ham, onions, and other fragrant things. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munich and Oberammergau 338</p>
<p>It was half the size of a football, and I could not eat as much as </p>
<p>half of that. </p>
<p>After a stop at a most baroque church on the mountain above </p>
<p>Oberammergau, we finally reached that village only twenty minutes </p>
<p>before the shops closed at four in the afternoon. This no doubt </p>
<p>saved us collectively a lot of money. We were able to glance into a </p>
<p>number of the woodcarvers' shops, but there was not time enough for </p>
<p>comparative shopping. My only souvenirs were two tiny hedgehogs </p>
<p>which still remind me of Herkemiah at Ak-Bulak as well as of </p>
<p>Oberammergau.</p>
<p>Munich became even more memorable as, early in the next week, I fell </p>
<p>victim to my last fairly serious attack of epididymitis. After </p>
<p>spending two days in pain in my bed in the Excelsior Hotel, I </p>
<p>managed to pull myself together and get to a plane to England, where </p>
<p>I had an appointment to give a colloquium at the Royal Air Force </p>
<p>research station at Farnborough. To my surprise and relief, the </p>
<p>trouble got better as I traveled and I was able to give my talk </p>
<p>without too much discomfort. I did not stay long in England, </p>
<p>however, and I am happy that since that year I have had no more than </p>
<p>twinges of my old difficulty.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>Rex's determination to see the Carnival in Trinidad bore bitter </p>
<p>fruit for him but much fun for me. By February, 1966, the Omega </p>
<p>station in Trinidad was ready for testing. We had made reservations </p>
<p>and taken steps to reserve (at our own expense) the necessary </p>
<p>tickets for the 8everal major Carnival attractions during the five </p>
<p>days ending with Shrove Tuesday.</p>
<p>Possibly Rex talked too much at the office. Or perhaps the idea of </p>
<p>Carnival was just too much to be resisted by his boss, Max Polk, the </p>
<p>Omega Project Officer. He bumped Rex and decided to do the </p>
<p>inspection of the station himself. I fancy that he tried to do the </p>
<p>same thing to me, as he wished to take along a close friend in the </p>
<p>Navy. If so, that scheme failed and I was allowed to make the trip </p>
<p>as planned. Max was a captain in the Navy, having the same rank as </p>
<p>that held by the commander of the Trinidad base. This fact was to </p>
<p>become very beneficial.</p>
<p>We arrived in Port of Spain with nearly a week of Carnival </p>
<p>remaining. The festivities had been. building up for several days </p>
<p>before that, with minor celebrations of many kinds, including many </p>
<p>parades through the city by steel orchestras each of which carried </p>
<p>with it a large group of celebrants jumping up. Max and I were met </p>
<p>by our official host, the resident captain, and given our tickets to </p>
<p>the various attractions, and also guest memberships at the Country </p>
<p>Club. These were thoughtfully made out in the names of Mr. and Mrs., </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="farewell">Farewell to Munich / Trinidad Again</b> </a>339</p>
<p>in case we wished to take along some substitutes. We were taken to </p>
<p>the same BOQ at Chaguaramas and were given the keys to a car rented </p>
<p>forus by the naval base.</p>
<p>In the first day or two we managed to make an hour's visit to the </p>
<p>Omega station, which was neat and clean and working perfectly, </p>
<p>though with limited power. After that visit, we were quite busy </p>
<p>sightseeing and learning how Carnival works. It seems that the </p>
<p>festivities are largely in the hands of bands, which are not musical </p>
<p>but groups of people ready to parade and perform together for </p>
<p>several days with little rest. One or two bands consisted of as few </p>
<p>as 300 people, but some of the more enterprising ones contained as </p>
<p>many as 2,000 celebrants. A band is reputed to begin preparing </p>
<p>costumes for the next Carnival within two weeks of the end of the </p>
<p>latest one. The costumes, in each band, are all coordinated to fit </p>
<p>with whatever theme the band has chosen. One of the more spectacular </p>
<p>bands in 1966 was dressed as Roman soldiers. The costumes were </p>
<p>little less than magnificent and, from a distance of a few yards, </p>
<p>showed no anachronisms and no imperfections of detail that we could </p>
<p>detect. This band was divided into four quarters, each in its own </p>
<p>color: red, green, blue, or yellow. Those in each color marched, or </p>
<p>danced, in a group. There were no differences in costume throughout </p>
<p>the band except for the color of the different regiments.</p>
<p>In its many public appearances, each band was accompanied by its own </p>
<p>orchestra (which is what, in this country, we would call a steel </p>
<p>band) often of a hundred performers. When the appqarance was at one </p>
<p>of the functions in front of the grandstand in the Queen's Park </p>
<p>Savannah, the orchestra would pass beside the ramp that led up to a </p>
<p>platform several feet high in front of the grandstand. Forming on </p>
<p>the far side of the platform, the orchestra would play jumpup music </p>
<p>while the band marched, a dozen abreast, up the ramp and danced its </p>
<p>way across to the descending ramp. I no longer have any idea how </p>
<p>many bands and orchestras there were, but they surely were numbered </p>
<p>in the dozens, if not scores.</p>
<p>The steel orchestra plays upon a family of instruments devised by an </p>
<p>unknown genius. He found that the top or bottom of a standard oil </p>
<p>drum (a very common commodity in Trinidad) could be made into a </p>
<p>surprisingly pleasant instrument. By properly heating, hammering, </p>
<p>and tempering the steel drumhead, a dozen or more dents or bosses </p>
<p>can be so shaped that each responds to a drumstick with a note in </p>
<p>the musical scale. A group of a hundred performers playing these </p>
<p>instruments can produce an exceedingly loud, yet very musical and </p>
<p>exciting result. Much music has been composed for these orchestras, </p>
<p>all of it toe-twitching and highly suitable for jumpups. These are a </p>
<p>kind of local dance that I find it totally impossible to describe. </p>
<p>It requires as much energy as go-go dancing but has, somehow, a more </p>
<p>joyful and less sexual character.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="carnival">Carnival</a></b> 340</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When driving around Port of Spain in the evening, we would often </p>
<p>meet a large group of dancers following an orchestra. We soon </p>
<p>realized the extent of their fatigue. Because the group occypied the </p>
<p>whole street we would, if cornered by it, turn off the engine and </p>
<p>let the dance sweep by us on both sides of the car, usually taking </p>
<p>ten or fifteen minutes to pass. The dance has, as its name implies, </p>
<p>rather more vertical than horizontal motion. Those dancers who </p>
<p>managed to get close enough to the small car would invariably lean </p>
<p>against the top, suported by an elbow, and allow the car to hold </p>
<p>them up as the rest of the crowd forced them along until they were </p>
<p>pushed off at the other end of the car.</p>
<p>It was probably on the Friday of the Carnival weeke9d that we were </p>
<p>moved into Port of Spain. For a time I did not understand why we </p>
<p>were being transferred to the Queen's Park Hotel, but the reason </p>
<p>ultimately became clear. There seems to be a rule that during </p>
<p>Carnival local people may not occupy rooms in hotels. We, as </p>
<p>foreigners, could have rooms that would be convenient as resting and </p>
<p>relieving places for the naval officers and their wives who would be </p>
<p>attending Carnival. As a result of these rules, the club took two </p>
<p>rooms in our names. One was a beautiful large one on the front of </p>
<p>the fourth floor, with a long balcony overlooking the street and </p>
<p>across to the savannah where the formal entertainments were held. </p>
<p>The second room was a small double one in the rear of the hotel </p>
<p>where it was hoped that it would be quiet enough for us to sleep. As </p>
<p>a matter of fact, noise from the festivities hardly bothered us at </p>
<p>all, as we did not often try to rest and, when we did, were </p>
<p>generally tired enough to sleep anyway. When we were taken to the </p>
<p>large room, we found an unusual feature. A big closet, had a shelf </p>
<p>bearing several dozen bottles of liquors. It seemed that the </p>
<p>officers' club had also provided this supply and used it on the </p>
<p>honor system, whereby each officer paid for what he used. As hosts, </p>
<p>Max and I were exempted from this arrangement and told to help </p>
<p>ourselves to these supplies as desired. It became common to find our </p>
<p>balcony occupied by several officers and wives, chiefly in the late </p>
<p>afternoon. Of course, the club liquor was far cheaper than that </p>
<p>served in the hotel bar downstairs.</p>
<p>I am sure that there was a major show on the main stage that Friday </p>
<p>night but do not recall just what it may have been, except that the </p>
<p>devil was a major character in the performance. Saturday night has </p>
<p>blotted Friday out of my memory. That was the night when the </p>
<p>attraction on the stage was the selection of the King and Queen of </p>
<p>the Carnival. These choices were supposed to be made entirely on the </p>
<p>basis of the best and most extravagant of the costumes worn by the </p>
<p>leaders of a dozen of the more prominent bands. These costumes were </p>
<p>generally so large and complex that the human in the middle was </p>
<p>visible only as a face, if that. Many, especially those worn by men, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="choice">Choice of the Queen of Carnival</b> </a>341</p>
<p>were often six or eight feet broad and deep, and many even higher </p>
<p>than that. One strong man representing King Neptune carried a </p>
<p>brilliantly decorated costume (on a sort of concealed scaffolding) </p>
<p>that was reputed to weigh three hundred pounds. He could only cross </p>
<p>the stage in little four-inch steps, obviously taken with great </p>
<p>effort.</p>
<p>One band, representing playing cards, violated this tradition. The </p>
<p>female leader was a "high yaller" woman well over six feet tall. She </p>
<p>wore a brilliant scarlet sleeveless floor-length gown that clung </p>
<p>closely to her superb figure. Her costume was a flat sheet of giant </p>
<p>playing cards that extended well out sideways but not at all to the </p>
<p>front or rear. This device concealed none of the lady's own charms, </p>
<p>which were copious, magnificent, or what adjectives have you?</p>
<p>Max and I realized from the reactions of the audience near us that </p>
<p>this violation of custom was most incorrect. By this time, however, </p>
<p>the effects of the officers'club liquor were being felt and we </p>
<p>applauded the playing-card lady vociferously at every appearance. At </p>
<p>the end of the show, toward one A.M., the decisions of the judges </p>
<p>were announced. To our surprise and delight, the judges also had </p>
<p>apparently been overcome by the lady's charms and the leader of the </p>
<p>playing cards was named Queen of the Carnival.</p>
<p>After this Saturday night show a certain conclusion had become </p>
<p>traditional. The part of the audience which had the use of the </p>
<p>Country Club went there when the show ended and enjoyed a jumpup </p>
<p>until five in the morning. At that hour it was correct to repair to </p>
<p>a church to take communion. Because Max was an Episcopalian, we went </p>
<p>to the service at the Church of England. I had never taken communion </p>
<p>in England but, even so, only one aspect of the rite surprised me. I </p>
<p>understood how the congregation knelt at the altar rail in groups of </p>
<p>forty or fifty; and, having seen it done in the movies or somewhere, </p>
<p>I was not surprised at the curious gesture of sticking out the </p>
<p>tongue for the priest to place the wafer on it. I was, however, </p>
<p>startled by the dexterity of the young priest in serving the wine. </p>
<p>It came in a sort of huge brandy snifter that would, when full, have </p>
<p>held at least two quarts. The priest held it cradled in one hand </p>
<p>with the other supporting the base. With some kind of a twitch I </p>
<p>could not fathom, he shot into each open mouth about a tablespoonful </p>
<p>of the wine. This, from a vessel with a four-inch hole at the top, </p>
<p>impressed me as a skill of a very high order.</p>
<p>The popular theory seemed to be that if, after taking communion, one </p>
<p>slept for the rest of the day on Sunday it should not be necessary </p>
<p>to go to bed again before midnight Tuesday. It. did not work that </p>
<p>way for us for, on Monday morning, we were awakened by a tremendous </p>
<p>noise that came echoing up through the atrium that extended upward </p>
<p>from the lobby of the hotel. It seemed that a large orchestra had, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="spirit">The Carnival Spirit</b> </a>342</p>
<p>formed up at the entrance of the hotel and suddenly started playing </p>
<p>surely the loudest music I ever heard. Further sleep instantly </p>
<p>became impossible.</p>
<p>Somehow the details about Monday escape me except that, in the early </p>
<p>evening, Max and I decided that we should stop drinking the Navy </p>
<p>bourbon and go downstairs to see what was being served at the hotel </p>
<p>bar. With difficulty we wormed our way through the crowd in the </p>
<p>lobby and got into the bar and provided ourselves with glasses of </p>
<p>planter's punch. Working my way back to the lobby, I looked (or a </p>
<p>clear spot and was lucky enough to find a corner with a pretty girl </p>
<p>alone in it. She was wearing a pair of silver earrings in the shape </p>
<p>of starfish. As a conversation opener, I asked if these were a </p>
<p>local product, because I thought our friend Madelene Pierce, a </p>
<p>marine biologist, would like a pair like them. The girl said that </p>
<p>they were a gift and she did not know where they came from. While </p>
<p>saying this, she removed the earrings, took off the matching brooch </p>
<p>that I had not noticed, and dropped them all into my shirt pocket. I </p>
<p>have often used this story as an excellent example of the spirit of </p>
<p>Carnival. The girl earned at least a good dinner by way of thanks </p>
<p>before rejoining her group of young people. She came from </p>
<p>Manchester, New Hampshire, and was employed as a teacher of English </p>
<p>in a company school in the Venezuela oilfields. She gave me her </p>
<p>address, but I was wise enough not to try to see her again. </p>
<p>Catherine enjoyed this story, but side-tracked the pin and earrings </p>
<p>before they ever got to Madelene. Catherine continued to wear them </p>
<p>frequently as long as she lived.</p>
<p>I must admit that we did get out to the Omega station a second time, </p>
<p>I think for at least an hour, during the week that we spent in </p>
<p>Trinidad. We also had lunch once with the commander of the base at </p>
<p>his lovely home overlooking the Dragon's Mouth. My only real </p>
<p>reflections of this occasion were of a very good meal and the </p>
<p>pleasure I took in seeing a five-foot iguana resting on a big branch </p>
<p>of a tree a few feet from the railing of the captain's porch.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the final entertainments in the Queen's Park Savannah </p>
<p>finished in the late afternoon. By that time, all were certainly </p>
<p>tired. Quite a naval group was chatting quietly, glasses in hand, on </p>
<p>our balcony as the last performers were leaving the savannah. The </p>
<p>band representing playing cards came out into the street and, for </p>
<p>some unknown reason stood around there with its center not more than </p>
<p>fifty yards from us. At this point something, perhaps whisky, </p>
<p>inspired me to get up and say, "I'm going down to see if she (the </p>
<p>Carnival Queen) is as beautiful close to as she is several yards </p>
<p>away." The lobby and street were fearfully crowded, but I put my </p>
<p>shoulder down as a wedge and forced my way out and down the road. I </p>
<p>had no way to tell how close I was getting to my objective until I </p>
<p>suddenly broke out of the crowd and into an open space a few feet in </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="endofcarnival">The End of Carnival / Norway</b> </a>343</p>
<p>diameter with the Queen, and me, conspicuous in the center. It had </p>
<p>not occurred to me to prepare any remarks for this occasion and I </p>
<p>was at the moment speechless with the surprise, as well as her </p>
<p>nearness and the overpowering smell of sweat from the lady and her </p>
<p>entire entourage. No way to explain my sudden appearance occurred to </p>
<p>me except to bow low, snatch the lady's hand, and kiss it, mumbling </p>
<p>congratulations on her selection for her high honor. I suspect that </p>
<p>she was the most surprised Carnival Queen in recent years as I </p>
<p>slipped back into the crowd. Looking up to our balcony when I got </p>
<p>free enough, I had a fine view of the naval group enjoying an acute </p>
<p>attack of hysterics. Max, of course, brought this story back to the </p>
<p>United State; amplifying it the while, and had much fun distributing </p>
<p>it among my friends. I am sure that his version, by the time he had </p>
<p>a chance to tell it to Catherine, was far better than mine.</p>
<p>As the Carnival was wearing to a close, surely from fatigue, the </p>
<p>Tuesday evening was spent at a jumpup at the Country Club. Our </p>
<p>fairly large group spent most of the evening over drinks at tables </p>
<p>bordering the dance floor. In the latter part of the evening, it was </p>
<p>a frequent occurrence. for one or another of Trinidad's very pretty </p>
<p>girls to slow down her dancing near one of our tables and ask the </p>
<p>time. One or another of us would look at his watch and reply, </p>
<p>perhaps, Ten-thirty. This almost invariably provoked the response, </p>
<p>Oh, my God! I'll never make it!</p>
<p>It became abundantly clear at midnight, when, the music and dancing </p>
<p>stopped. The room was instantly littered with bodies, lying wherever </p>
<p>they happened to be when the Carnival period ended. The same was </p>
<p>true of the city in general, as in our drive back to the hotel </p>
<p>similar inert forms were to be seen scattered over the lawns, </p>
<p>sidewalks, and even streets.</p>
<p>In the morning the base commander came to take us to the airport, </p>
<p>first paying our hotel bill from a large wad of American hundred-</p>
<p>dollar notes. These were, he assured us carefully, officers' club </p>
<p>funds, not naval ones.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>In August of 1966, Dick Woodward, Lowman Tibbals, the leader of the </p>
<p>Omega work at NEL and my closest friend there, and I flew to England </p>
<p>for a meeting with the radio navigation people at the Royal Aircraft </p>
<p>Establishment, and then to Norway to see the Omega station being </p>
<p>built there. This was a double pleasure for Dick and me because just </p>
<p>after World War II we had had a two-years' acquaintance with Bjorn </p>
<p>Rorholt, a young Norwegian flyer. He had served in the Underground </p>
<p>during the war, had flown in some capacity with Bernt Balchen, and </p>
<p>had frequently been parachuted into his homeland. His services in </p>
<p>the war had earned him a reward of two years in America, most of </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The End of Carnival / Norway 344</p>
<p>which he chose to spend working with my research group at Harvard. I </p>
<p>still have no idea why he made this choice. In the intervening years </p>
<p>he had become a colonel in the Air Force and, in 1966, was serving </p>
<p>as Chief of Communications for the Norwegian Joint Services. This </p>
<p>gave him a professional as well as personal interest in Omega and </p>
<p>also in the big VLF communication station then being built for NATO </p>
<p>in northern Norway.</p>
<p>Bjorn had mistaken our date and we surprised him in the morning a </p>
<p>day earlier than he had expected. Nonetheless, he rose to the </p>
<p>occasion, arranging an excellent dinner for us on that same day. </p>
<p>This introduced a Norwegian custom new to us. Many people choose to </p>
<p>work from morning until about four in the afternoon and then enjoy </p>
<p>the big meal of the day, to be followed by supper some time in the </p>
<p>evening. Our meal was obviously at one of the better restaurants and </p>
<p>I enjoyed my first ptarmigan although I have forgotten the </p>
<p>Norwegian name for it. Another small group had been invited to meet </p>
<p>us. These were the senior engineers engaged in building the NATO VLF </p>
<p>station. I was pleased to find that this group was headed by my old </p>
<p>acquaintance Captain Burke, who had retired from the Navy after </p>
<p>completing thq big VLF station at Cutler, Maine. Nothing untoward </p>
<p>happened at the dinner, but we found out later that Mr. Burke and </p>
<p>Bjorn were rather at swords' points over many diplomatic problems </p>
<p>concerning the construction of the station. Apparently each of the </p>
<p>parties to the controversy had been throwing his weight about to an </p>
<p>unnecessary degree.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a few days later, the same people, with others, </p>
<p>attended a large cocktail party given, if I remember rightly, by the </p>
<p>American company which had the contract under NATO. At this function </p>
<p>I performed one of my easiest and most successful diplomatic chores. </p>
<p>I spent much of the evening, cocktail glass in hand, chatting with </p>
<p>the heads of the two groups, telling each of them some of the </p>
<p>stories I happened to know about the achievements of the other in </p>
<p>various difficult situations. I was to hear later that, while Burke </p>
<p>and Rorholt did not become bosom friends, they did decide to respect </p>
<p>each other, and afterwards worked together very successfully.</p>
<p>In a few days we saw some of the charms of Oslo, of which I remember </p>
<p>chiefly Vigeland's amazing statues in Frogner Park. We also spent an </p>
<p>interesting time visiting Tron Horn, the chief expert in stringing </p>
<p>long cables over fiords, which is very necessary in building the </p>
<p>Norwegian electric system. I was surprised to learn that, in the </p>
<p>climate of northern Norway, one of the desirable reatures is to let </p>
<p>the center of a long span drop to about a thousand feet over the </p>
<p>water. If the center were higher than that, there would be an </p>
<p>unnecessarily great strain on the cable, while if it drooped lower </p>
<p>heavier ice-loading would make the total strain greater than it need </p>
<p>be. I asked Mr. Horn what was the length of the longest span in the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="elementary">Elementary Diplomacy</b> </a>345</p>
<p>electric system. After a few seconds of thought he amazed me by </p>
<p>saying "About five kilometers, or 3.1 miles." This man's experience </p>
<p>was of great value to Omega, of course, although, in a mountain </p>
<p>antenna, there is a great premium for not letting the spans droop </p>
<p>lower that safety demands.</p>
<p>Omega profited by the use of a cable-hanging ship, made by equipping </p>
<p>a wartime landing craft with hoisting engines and cable reels. This </p>
<p>ship was sent anywhere it was needed for such purposes as raising </p>
<p>the Omega antenna. In this case, as in some others, it had been </p>
<p>necessary to hoist the necessary gear by helicopter to the tops of </p>
<p>the mountains. These were so fractured by freezing and thawing that </p>
<p>they had little structural integrity. The first operation was to </p>
<p>drill dozens of holes through the rock and pump into them enough </p>
<p>cement to make the whole peak of each mountain one block of </p>
<p>concrete. After sufficiently strong pulleys had been mounted at the </p>
<p>take-off points, the cable ship would string the antenna anross the </p>
<p>fiord, buoying it up to lie easily at the surface. Lines would then </p>
<p>be carried up at each end of each span, reeved through the pulleys, </p>
<p>and brought back down to the winches on the cable ship. Sailing as </p>
<p>necessary from one side of the fiord to the other, the cable ship </p>
<p>could then hoist each antenna strand into position, so that men on </p>
<p>the mountains could make permanent attachments. The antenna at </p>
<p>Aldra, as the island is called, or more properly at Bratland, the </p>
<p>name of the hamlet on the mainland, was used for a time with two </p>
<p>strands across the water. These were later extended by addition of a </p>
<p>third, each of the three going to a different peak on the mainland.</p>
<p>Dick and I, who had known Bjorn in Cambridge, had a very pleasant </p>
<p>dinner with him and his wife, whom we had also known as they had </p>
<p>been married while he was in America. We were especially delighted </p>
<p>with his smoked salmon, which he had caught himself and had had </p>
<p>smoked by some great expert in that ancient art. Bjorn was proud, </p>
<p>not to say vain, of these fish, and had long been promising us (by </p>
<p>mail) that he would have some waiting for us when we got to Oslo. </p>
<p>The salmon were fully worthy of his praises, being the most delicate </p>
<p>and delicious that I ever ate.</p>
<p>After a few days of introductions to the city and to military and </p>
<p>other people interested in either Omega or the NATO communication </p>
<p>station, Dick, Lowman, and I were escorted to the edge of the arctic </p>
<p>by Bjorn himself. We flew to Trondheim by commercial aircraft and </p>
<p>then went further north in a Norwegian Air Force helicopter. This </p>
<p>was, we quickly discovered, a magnificent way to view the fiord </p>
<p>country. We flew, usually, at more or less half the height of the </p>
<p>mountains so that we had elegant views into the fiords. The </p>
<p>sightseeing ships full of tourists looked like pretty toys below us.</p>
<p>Landing near the site of the future NATO station, we were shown the </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="oslo">Cable Hanging Techniques / Oslo</b> </a>346</p>
<p>rocky saddle inside which three caverns had been excavated. These </p>
<p>were to be the rooms for the large transmitter and for the two </p>
<p>outlying loading coils for the two halves of the mountain antenna. A </p>
<p>light strand of antenna had been suspended across the valley with a </p>
<p>lead-in down to a hut on the top of the saddle, where a small </p>
<p>transmitter was being used for the first actual tests at the site. </p>
<p>We climbed the saddle, several hundred feet high and covered by </p>
<p>rocks and brush, in our city clothes as a snowstorm was beginning. </p>
<p>This may have been the first occasion on which I felt the effects of </p>
<p>the emphysema that had resulted from forty years of smoking, as I </p>
<p>remember that I had great difficulty in keeping up with the other </p>
<p>members of the party, and that they clearly felt a little concerned </p>
<p>about my difficult breathing and fatigue. To this day, I do not know </p>
<p>why we climbed this minor obstacle, except that Bjorn was so pleased </p>
<p>with the progress being made on the station that he wished us to see </p>
<p>every detail.</p>
<p>I found the tunnel that had been bored through the width of the </p>
<p>saddle very interesting. Bjorn had a story, which I don't </p>
<p>necessarily believe, that the Norwegians had talked NATO into </p>
<p>financing this access route, between the tuning points and the </p>
<p>transmitter, because it was desired as a passage for school children </p>
<p>between their homes at one end and their school at the other. If </p>
<p>this be true, I can easily understand the desire of parents not to </p>
<p>have to send their children up over this saddle in the winter. We </p>
<p>observed that the tunnel was quite large, permitting a two-lane road </p>
<p>of generous width, and was entirely rough and unfinished above </p>
<p>although the road was smoothly paved. Apparently both of these </p>
<p>features were matters of economy. The size was especially important </p>
<p>as it allowed ordinary earth-moving equipment to move in and out </p>
<p>readily during the tunneling; and it was left untiled because that </p>
<p>was considered to be a necessary economy. In Norway, excavating in </p>
<p>the rock is common and is done very professionally. Biorn told us </p>
<p>that the entire tunnel, a little less than a mile long, had been </p>
<p>bored (from both ends) in three months and at a cost of half a </p>
<p>million dollars. We Americans agreed that in our homeland the plans </p>
<p>alone for such a tunnel would have cost a half million, and that the </p>
<p>time taken for the whole would probably have been three years rather </p>
<p>than three months.</p>
<p>This is as good a time as any to mention a legend we heard several </p>
<p>times. It seems that trolls resent the activities of humans in these </p>
<p>northern climes unless the people excavate places in the rocks that </p>
<p>may serve as accomodations for the trolls. It is therefore wise to </p>
<p>dig as much as possible to divert the malicious actions that </p>
<p>otherwise might ensue. We usually heard this story from trained </p>
<p>engineers, some of whom had studied in England or America. It was </p>
<p>obvious that these acquaintances tried to laugh as they spoke about </p>
<p>the trolls; nevertheless we fancied that we detected a </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="trolls">Trolls / Bodo</b> </a>347</p>
<p>stratum of belief underlying the amusement.</p>
<p>As we left the NATO site and flew toward Bodo, where we had hotel </p>
<p>accomodations, I learned about a most convenient ability of a </p>
<p>helicopter in such a northern region. After a time the snow became </p>
<p>so thick that the aircraft's windshield wiper failed to keep up with </p>
<p>the accumulation. When this condition became severe, the pilot would </p>
<p>find a small place along the shore where he had room to land. He </p>
<p>could then get out and scrape the windshield clean!</p>
<p>Bodo is a small city of perhaps 30,000 people, and is the capital of </p>
<p>Nordland county, if that is what such a region is called in Norway. </p>
<p>It was essentially new and notably neat (even for a town in Norway) </p>
<p>because it had been totally destroyed by the German occupation </p>
<p>forces during World War II. We arrived late and left early, so I </p>
<p>really recall little more than a very good dinner in the hotel.</p>
<p>When we visited the Omega station, a half dozen miles south of the </p>
<p>arctic circle, we were lucky enough to see a fantastic feat of </p>
<p>helicopter flying. The station was then operating, though at less </p>
<p>than nominal power, and there was still much construction activity </p>
<p>on the mountains. As time had passed it had been found that the top </p>
<p>of the mountain on the mainland was enshrouded by clouds too </p>
<p>frequently. A cableway had therefore been constructed to the top </p>
<p>from a flattish area about a third of the way up. A commercial </p>
<p>helicopter was employed in flying supplies, such as sand and cement, </p>
<p>up from the edge of the sea to the lower end of the cableway. The </p>
<p>small helicopter was paid by the ton hoisted to the plateau and the </p>
<p>pilot therefore wasted little time in returning after he had dropped </p>
<p>a load. Instead of flying down in a normal attitude, he would tip </p>
<p>the helicopter up to an angle less steep than the slope of the </p>
<p>mountain and slide down at an increasing speed. In this part of the </p>
<p>trip the forward-moving tips of the blades of the helicopter </p>
<p>exceeded the speed of sound. The descent was thus made to the </p>
<p>accompaniment of rapid succession of sounds like the explosions of </p>
<p>giant firecrackers, which could be heard from a distance of six or </p>
<p>eight miles.</p>
<p>As we approached the station, our military helicopter toured the </p>
<p>antenna supports at the tops of the mountains and then landed a mile </p>
<p>or two from the station where there was a flat place at which we </p>
<p>could wait for cars from the station to pick us up. During this </p>
<p>pause the commercial helicopter came banging down the slope. The </p>
<p>pilot was clearly minded to show the Air Force crew that they were </p>
<p>not the only ones who could fly helicopters. Instead of stopping at </p>
<p>the normal place to pick up his next load, the pilot continued </p>
<p>another half mile along the coast, still at a very high speed. He </p>
<p>came over the water at a height of no more than ten or fifteen feet </p>
<p>until nearly opposite us and at a couple of hundred feet out from </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="construction">Construction on the Mountain</b> </a>348</p>
<p>the shore. As he reached this point he swung the aircraft up into a </p>
<p>steep climb and checked his ground speed by accelerating his engine. </p>
<p>This maneuver brought him to a complete stop at a height of about </p>
<p>fifty yards. At the peak, his rotor blades seemed exactly vertical, </p>
<p>for a moment. As he dropped he returned to the horizontal, with the </p>
<p>engine still at full throttle, brought the helicopter into a normal </p>
<p>attitude only a few yards above the water, and chugged sedately back </p>
<p>to his base to pick up his next load. We were sorry that there was </p>
<p>no way for him to know how deep an impression he had made. Our </p>
<p>flight crew could only fill our ears with excuses because the Air </p>
<p>Force would not allow them to try such a stunt.</p>
<p>As suggested above, the Omega antenna in Norway had required much </p>
<p>reinforcing work on the mountains at the ends of the strands of </p>
<p>cable. Some details are of interest. On the mainland side, the </p>
<p>mountain top approached knife-edge sharpness. Before even the </p>
<p>solidification process could be begun, much material and several </p>
<p>workmen had to be hoisted to the top. The first operation was to </p>
<p>lower men and supplies to build a small cabin and a landing pad for </p>
<p>the helicopter. The former was needed at once to provide a place </p>
<p>where a few men could stay when a cloud descended on the mountain </p>
<p>with little warning. The very idea of the landing platform gives me </p>
<p>qualms. It was a square wooden structure three meters on a side! To </p>
<p>find a perch for even a small helicopter on this, with such a steep </p>
<p>mountain ridge under it and when buffeted by the winds to be </p>
<p>expected in such a high and exposed situation, must have called for </p>
<p>a pilot with the traditional nerves of steel. It should be no </p>
<p>surprise that the later work took advantage of the cableway.</p>
<p>It is curious that seeing the Omega station did not interest me as </p>
<p>much as hearing these stories about how things are done in Norway. </p>
<p>Of course, I had previously seen many radio transmitters, all of </p>
<p>them very similar, and some had presented far greater engineering </p>
<p>problems. In any case, many of my reactions in Norway were similar </p>
<p>to those I had felt when I learned of the cheap telephone </p>
<p>communication available on the Finnish ship in 1936.</p>
<p>The peaks of surprise and admiration came when we were back in Oslo </p>
<p>and Bjorn took us to see the headquarters station of the military </p>
<p>ultra-high-frequency communication network. This station was </p>
<p>invisible to the eye of the casual visitor. We were introduced to it </p>
<p>when Bjorn drove us up to the television tower on the heights at the </p>
<p>end of Oslofiord. This was the standard European tapered tower of </p>
<p>reinforced concrete with antennas at the top and below them a bulge </p>
<p>two rooms wide and several stories high. This space contained the TV </p>
<p>operating rooms and transmitters. When we approached the tower, </p>
<p>instead of continuing to the normal parking area around the base, </p>
<p>Biorn turned off the road into an unimproved dirt track through a </p>
<p>grove of small trees fifty or more yards below the top of the hill. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="invisible">An Invisible Communication Network</b> </a>349</p>
<p>He parked at the edge of this road at the back of the hill, near a </p>
<p>small building rather like the end of a small garage partly buried </p>
<p>in the sloping ground. A key unlocked a padlock on an </p>
<p>undistinguished yet sturdy door leading into a small tunnel, as </p>
<p>rough and unfinished as the much larger one we had seen at the site </p>
<p>of the NATO station in Nordland. This tunnel led us horizontally </p>
<p>into the hill for a hundred yards or more and ended at an obviously </p>
<p>stronger door with a more impressive lock. Beyond this, we found </p>
<p>ourselves in a brightly lighted and highly modern communication </p>
<p>station containing many transmitters and some of the offices of the </p>
<p>military network.</p>
<p>This cavern was directly under the television tower and buried far </p>
<p>underground. Another locked door let us into an elevator car which </p>
<p>we found was the normal one used by the public for access to the </p>
<p>observation gallery in the bulge. Buttons in the elevator allowed </p>
<p>the public to travel between the ground floor and souvenir shop, the </p>
<p>TV transmitter area, and the observation gallery, but showed no </p>
<p>indication that there was anything below the ground level or that </p>
<p>there were a couple of levels in the bulge that contained parabolic </p>
<p>antennas for the military system. These levels were reached by the </p>
<p>use of a key to an inconspicuous lock on the elevator control panel.</p>
<p>The antennas of the military system were pointed as necessary in the </p>
<p>directions to relay points leading to all parts of the country. All </p>
<p>of this network was more or less parallel to the normal telephone </p>
<p>system but was completely independ0nt.</p>
<p>The antennas in the tower were not the only resource of this </p>
<p>installation. Scattered in the woods below the public parking area, </p>
<p>but still not far below the top of the hill, there were a number of </p>
<p>small wooden buildings that could only be called shacks. These had </p>
<p>been red, but the paint was blistered and peeling, and the small </p>
<p>windows looked as though they had not been cleaned for years. They </p>
<p>were so dingy that, from the outside, one could not detect that they </p>
<p>concealed almost nothing except large holes in the ground. These </p>
<p>buildings covered reserve parabolic antennas, all mounted on </p>
<p>hydraulic lifts that could, in an emergency involving loss of the </p>
<p>television tower, be activated to bring these antennas up to a </p>
<p>considerable height with each pointed in exactly the right </p>
<p>direction.</p>
<p>All of this ingenuity was not what most impressed me. This system </p>
<p>had been set up in a way that could not be imagined in the United </p>
<p>States. All of the electronic equipment had been picked up in the </p>
<p>surplus market, subject only to the requirement that it could work </p>
<p>reliably at the correct frequencies. We saw labels from Philco and </p>
<p>General Electric, the English Marconi Company, and one or two French </p>
<p>and German suppliers. There is much to be said for using ingenuity </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Invisible Communication Network 350</p>
<p>and determination instead of dollars.</p>
<p>The most surprising bit of data Bjorn gave us was that this entire </p>
<p>network of, I believe, 140 stations was operated by a total full-</p>
<p>time staff of less than that number of people. The stations, </p>
<p>scattered completely around the entire perimeter of Norway, were </p>
<p>capable of operating unattended. At every site an inhabitant nearby, </p>
<p>perhaps a farmer with no more than minimal technical understanding, </p>
<p>was kept on notice to get to the station in case of any failure. If </p>
<p>he could reactivate the power supply or make some other correction, </p>
<p>well and good. If the difficulty were beyond his capacity, he was </p>
<p>authorized to call upon any facilities of the Norwegian armed </p>
<p>services. They would respond at once to any call for help and </p>
<p>enquire into the degree of necessity only after the station had been </p>
<p>restored to full operation.</p>
<p>One unimportant detail pleased me. At Harvard, my group had used </p>
<p>some morse code intercommunication between rooms. A single letter </p>
<p>was the call of each person. That letter plus a question mark meant, </p>
<p>Where are you? and would be answered by a room number. An </p>
<p>individual's letter followed by a number meant to answer a telephone </p>
<p>call on that particular line, and so on through many brief messages </p>
<p>and responses. Bjorn had apparently liked this arrangement and we </p>
<p>found a trace of it in this military network. A call to, say, the </p>
<p>Nordland area would start with what corresponds to our area code. </p>
<p>The area would respond with a dial tone so interrupted as to form a </p>
<p>repeated morse letter, thus confirming at once that the caller had </p>
<p>reached the correct zone before he dialed the local number.</p>
<p>We were not asked to keep any of this information secret. The whole </p>
<p>apparatus was simply made inconspicuous. This has many advantages as </p>
<p>compared with an activity that inspires curiosity, as the Norwegians </p>
<p>clearly knew as well as anyone.</p>
<p>It happened that Dick and I finished our visits in Norway three or </p>
<p>four days earlier than we had expected. We went immediately to </p>
<p>London, hoping to change our reservations to cross the Atlantic. </p>
<p>This was when we discovered that the tourist season no longer ends </p>
<p>at Labor Day. It was impossible to arrange an earlier departure, so </p>
<p>we became simple tourists and had a very relaxed and pleasant time. </p>
<p>We visited the Tower of London (for me, at least, the first time </p>
<p>since 1936) and took sightseeing-bus rides that brought us to </p>
<p>museums new to us, and to other attractions. I even surprised myself </p>
<p>by spending an hour and a half in happy contemplation of da Vinci's </p>
<p>Madonna of the Rocks while Dick wandered in other parts of the </p>
<p>National Gallery. For some reason I don't understand, in London I </p>
<p>have always been able to reserve theater tickets at short notice, </p>
<p>and we took full advantage of that happy arrangement. So we managed </p>
<p>to pass the required time with no boredom whatever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>In 1967 it seemed to us that a trip to see the World's Fair at </p>
<p>Montreal might be our last chance to do something as a family before </p>
<p>the children stopped having long summer vacations. Bob was then 22 </p>
<p>and Joy 20 years of age. We accordingly chose a date, bought </p>
<p>passports to the Fair, and arranged reservations in Montreal.</p>
<p>Catherine ran into an obstacle when she suggested leaving our </p>
<p>dachshund, Gretchen, in a kennel. The dog was such a pet of all of </p>
<p>us that Catherine received no second to this motion. We therefore </p>
<p>saw to getting all Gretchen's innoculation and health certificates, </p>
<p>while Bob applied to his Draft Board for permission to leave the </p>
<p>country, a requirement that very much disgusted him. At the Canadian </p>
<p>border, in both directions, the immigration officials surprised us </p>
<p>by carefully reading every word on the dogs papers while they </p>
<p>politely declined to be interested in Bob's permission. I doubt that </p>
<p>he was ever again so insulted!</p>
<p>Our reservation turned out to be in a little French rooming house. </p>
<p>We found it conveniently located and equipped, and even with </p>
<p>elementary kitchen facilities, but the four separate beds we had </p>
<p>requested did not seem to be available. It was unfortunate that my </p>
<p>French was far behind me, if it ever had been useful in spoken form, </p>
<p>while no one at that time in the house knew any English. We finally </p>
<p>worked it out that the proprietor, who spoke English but operated </p>
<p>two similar places, would not be available until supper time. So an </p>
<p>afternoon was practically wasted before he arrived and so juggled </p>
<p>rooms that we were satisfied. Once this had been done, we found the </p>
<p>place quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>My French had another hard time in the morning when I was sent out </p>
<p>to get coffee for all, with varying demands for no sugar, or no </p>
<p>cream, or double cream. The only cafe' in the immediate neighborhood </p>
<p>was presided over by a statuesque and beautiful woman who had the </p>
<p>greatest difficulty in detecting what I wanted, but I finally got </p>
<p>all the orders filled correctly. Thereafter, for some reason or </p>
<p>other, I recall no further linguistic difficulties.</p>
<p>The problem of Gretchen solved itself beautifully. A small animal </p>
<p>hospital not too far away would take her as a day student if we </p>
<p>would pick her up each evening before dinner. The dachshund adjusted </p>
<p>well to this regime and we had the pleasure of her company at night. </p>
<p>We also found an ideal place for breakfast next door to the animal </p>
<p>hospital, so we patronized that regularly and reserved our own </p>
<p>kitchen facilities for snacks. The breakfast place had a curious </p>
<p>pricing method which I discovered by experience. Our bill was always </p>
<p>75 cents each plus 15 cents, no matter how much or how little anyone </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="expo">Facilities at Expo</b> </a>67 352</p>
<p>ordered.</p>
<p>At the Fair we let the children pretty much alone to wait in line, </p>
<p>if they wished, for the most popular exhibits while, with one </p>
<p>exception, Catherine and I set a policy of going in to see only </p>
<p>those things that did not require any waiting at all. Joy happened </p>
<p>to have a school friend living in Montreal, so she spent much time </p>
<p>doing things with her. Bob made new acquaintances as necessary and </p>
<p>took care of himself very well, so we met occasionally by </p>
<p>appointment or sometimes only when we got back to our quarters at </p>
<p>night.</p>
<p>It happened that I had suffered a ruptured spinal disc a year or two </p>
<p>before and in 1967 was using a rather rough and large cane. This led </p>
<p>to two interesting events. When we first went to the exposition </p>
<p>grounds it seemed best to start by taking a ride on the minirail, an </p>
<p>elevated transit system that ran through much of the fair grounds. </p>
<p>We found one of its stations close to the entrance and rode around </p>
<p>to see how the various areas were arranged. It was natural that the </p>
<p>minirail ride ended at the Canadian Pavilion, so we went in to see </p>
<p>that first. Outside, we had noticed a number of Royal Canadian </p>
<p>Mounted Police in their scarlet uniforms and had not yet discovered </p>
<p>that the Expo police wore entirely different uniforms. Inside, the </p>
<p>Canadian art exhibit seemed the best one to start with, so we went </p>
<p>in there and found it interesting enough to keep us for thirty or </p>
<p>forty minutes looking into various galleries. After a time I </p>
<p>realized that wherever I went there was a Mountie within a yard or </p>
<p>two of me. As I moved from one gallery to another, sometimes a </p>
<p>policeman would wander along with me, and at other times I would </p>
<p>find a different one in the next gallery. Just as this fact began to </p>
<p>worry me, there was a flurry of activity at the other end of the </p>
<p>large room we were in. A group of eight or ten people, most of them </p>
<p>in correct morning dress, were escorting two well-dressed but more </p>
<p>informal visitors. As this group passed out of the pavilion, all of </p>
<p>the Mounted Police vanished as well. Before we ourselves left we </p>
<p>made some enquiries and tound that the distinguished visitors were </p>
<p>the King and Queen of Greece, being shown through the exhibits. The </p>
<p>security force in the scarlet coats had obviously been unsure that </p>
<p>my stout cane did not conceal a firearm. With perfect courtesy, they </p>
<p>never approached me but made sure that one officer or another should </p>
<p>always have me within his reach.</p>
<p>At almost the end of our visit the cane had a different, but equally </p>
<p>courteous, result. Until then, Catherine and I had clung to our </p>
<p>policy of not waiting in line. There was, however, an unusually </p>
<p>excellent international art exhibition that we all wanted to see. On </p>
<p>several different days we had failed to get to this museum before it </p>
<p>bacame filled. Expo 67 had an admirable policy of allowing visitors </p>
<p>into the museum until a comfortable number were inside, and then </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="artexhibition">The International Art Exhibition</b> </a>353</p>
<p>admitting others only as the earlier arrivals left. On our last day, </p>
<p>we again failed to get to this exhibit before a long waiting line </p>
<p>had formed. We decided that we had no alternative but to wait.</p>
<p>After about five minutes of leaning on my cane at the end of the </p>
<p>long line, I was approached by one of the regular Fair police. </p>
<p>Without preamble, be said to me, "Are you alone?" I replied, "No. We </p>
<p>are a family of four." "Bring them", he said, rather brusquely, and </p>
<p>led us toward the side of the museum. On the way, he kept using his </p>
<p>walkie-talkie, speaking in French. At a looked side door, a second </p>
<p>policeman let us in and conducted us to an elevator so that we </p>
<p>avoided a long flight of stairs to the exhibition area. This </p>
<p>courtesy saved us what I bad estimated as two hours of waiting; </p>
<p>extra time that we were delighted to have at the exhibit. Catherine </p>
<p>and I each found a few paintings we had admired, either in Russia or </p>
<p>in western Europe, and since then had wondered whether we would ever </p>
<p>see these old friends again. I am sure that this exhibit was, for </p>
<p>us, the highlight of the Fair.</p>
<p>I no longer remember any of the other national or state exhibits </p>
<p>except for the Finnish artifacts that were displayed in a most </p>
<p>memorable way. Large frames enclosed collections of all sorts of </p>
<p>manufactured objects, from sets of china to tapestries and even gun </p>
<p>barrels, all so grouped as to simulate impressive art. The </p>
<p>cumulative effect of a large room full of patterned groups of this </p>
<p>sort was overpowering and still not forgotten.</p>
<p>Recalling our happiness at the New York World's Fair in 1939 and </p>
<p>1940, we searched for but could not find a Finnish place where we </p>
<p>could rest and drink coffee and eat schmeerbrot (however it should </p>
<p>be spelled) the delicious open-faced sandwiches of Scandinavia and </p>
<p>Finland. Catherine did presently discover the approximate equivalent </p>
<p>in the Scandinavian Pavilion. This was nothing more than the wide </p>
<p>entrance hall leading to an excellent dining room and an equally </p>
<p>good bar. There were little tables along the sides ot this area, </p>
<p>where we could sit interminably and be brought delightful sandwiches </p>
<p>of smoked salmon, shrimp, or even scrambled egg and eel, drinking </p>
<p>akavit and watching the long lines of untutored patrons standing in </p>
<p>line for hours to get into the dining room, We spent a large part of </p>
<p>many happy evenings there.</p>

<b><p><a name="solar">Solar Eclipses</a></p>
</b><p>Having been an astronomer before her marriage, Catherine was </p>
<p>interested in eclipses of the sun and had had an excellent chance to </p>
<p>see her first one not far from Mount Holyoke College while still a </p>
<p>student there. I cared little about these phenomena, before the one </p>
<p>in the Soviet Union at which I met Catherine. Thereafter we both </p>
<p>paid more than casual attention to them. It is now at least fun for </p>
<p>me to recount the circumstances in which one or both of us made such </p>
<p>an attempt. The order might as well be chronological.</p>
<p>1. January 24, 1925</p>
<p>At this date Catherine was a sophomore in South Hadley and already </p>
<p>studying astronomy. She was, during her undergraduate years, keeping </p>
<p>a line-a-day diary. In it I find no mention of the eclipse until </p>
<p>January 14 when she saw Miss Farnsworth about the eclipse. On the </p>
<p>morning of the 24th, Catherine and other interested girls took the </p>
<p>seven o'clock train to Windsor, Connecticut, some thirty miles </p>
<p>south, and watched the eclipse on a brilliant winter morning. In her </p>
<p>diary she wrote, "Eclipse wonderful. Got our shadow bands OK.", but </p>
<p>found it equally worthy of mention that there were 69 more days </p>
<p>before spring vacation.</p>
<p>On the same day I was suffering from having to take the final </p>
<p>examination in a course on Ancient Civilizations at the University </p>
<p>of Maine. I have not yet forgiven Professor Huddleston for ruling </p>
<p>that my only choices were to see the eclipse or to pass the course. </p>
<p>He would not even let me go to the window for a quick look at the, </p>
<p>partial phase. I now remember almost nothing about the course except </p>
<p>for one of the professorial jokes: Mark Antony went down to Egypt </p>
<p>and tripped over Cleopatra. He got up, brushed himself off, and </p>
<p>said, Excuse me, and wilt thou?' -- and she wilted! I am not at all </p>
<p>sure that the joke is worth more than seeing the eclipse.</p>
<p>April 28, 1930</p>
<p>This interesting eclipse occurred during Catherine's years at the </p>
<p>Lick Observatory. It was a California special, being of almost </p>
<p>unique brevity. The earth was so nearly at the extreme end of the </p>
<p>penumbral shadow of the moon that the eclipse was reputed to be </p>
<p>total on the mountains and annular in the valleys along the path of </p>
<p>totality. Catherine saw it, but I do not remember just where. She </p>
<p>reported the width of the shadow as only a hundred yards or so, and </p>
<p>that a group trying to observe the eclipse had to make very careful </p>
<p>observations of the positions of the sun and moon in the weeks </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="moreeclipses">More Eclipses</b> </a>355</p>
<p>before the eclipse and did, in fact, move its camp once or twice to </p>
<p>be sure of being on the centerline at the right time. I. find that </p>
<p>the duration of the eclipse was predicted to be 1.5 seconds, but it </p>
<p>could not have been so long if Catherine's figure for the breadth of </p>
<p>the shadow is correct.</p>
<p>For my own part, I am sure that I never heard of this eclipse until </p>
<p>after I met Catherine.</p>
<p>3. August 31, 1932</p>
<p>Catherine was travelling in Europe at the time of this eclipse, </p>
<p>which came in the era when I was experimenting with 5-meter amateur </p>
<p>radio. I rather foolishly drove over to the region at the base of </p>
<p>Mount Washington to see if I could detect any eclipse-induced </p>
<p>variation in a signal from the top of the mountain. The weather </p>
<p>turned out to be rainy with solid clouds.</p>
<p>The only happy result of my effort was my making, by way of radio, </p>
<p>the acquaintance of Alexander McKenzie, who would become a lifelong </p>
<p>friend. He was then operating an experimental station on the top of </p>
<p>the mountain; the nucleus of the present Mount Washington </p>
<p>Observatory. Mac, or Alex, which he now prefers, turned up again as </p>
<p>the editor in our Loran division, where he.was responsible for the </p>
<p>clarity of most of our reports. He also became one of the editors of </p>
<p>the book about Loran which was published as volume four of the </p>
<p>Radiation Laboratory Series of twenty-eight books about the wartime </p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>4. June 19, 1936</p>
<p>This was, to me, the most important eclipse that ever happened. It, </p>
<p>or at least the trip to the Soviet Union and return, has already </p>
<p>been fully described in Chapter 7.</p>
<p>5. October 1, 1940</p>
<p>Catherine and I attended this one together in South Africa, as </p>
<p>described at great length above in Chapters 10 and 11.</p>
<p>6. July 9, 1945</p>
<p>At this time Catherine was busy taking care of our eight-month-old </p>
<p>son, Bob. I was equally busy making tests on Low Frequency Loran. In </p>
<p>this connection I wished to examine these new signals over land at a </p>
<p>considerable distance. It occurred to me that it would be amusing to </p>
<p>drop in on Dr. Donald Menzel, the former leader of the eclipse, </p>
<p>expedition to the Soviet Union, who was preparing to study an </p>
<p>eclipse in western Canada. It was easy to fit these two enterprises </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="telster">The "Telster" Eclipse</b> </a>356</p>
<p>together, so I took the small plane, which had been lent us by the </p>
<p>Army Air Force for testing purposes, to Regina, Saskatchewan. There </p>
<p>I talked two officers of the Royal Canadian Air Force into driving a </p>
<p>staff car the hundred miles to Bredenbury. where Don's eclipse camp </p>
<p>had been set up.</p>
<p>Everything started smoothly. I walked into Don's tent but, as I </p>
<p>should have expected, he was so busy that, he hardly noticed me. I </p>
<p>did, however, have an opportunity to meet a lady astronomer from the </p>
<p>Lick Observatory who remembered Catherine vividly. When the eclipse </p>
<p>arrived, fairly early in the morning, there was a dense cloud </p>
<p>overhead but with a completely clear sky all around the horizon in a </p>
<p>band from five to ten degrees wide. Thus we missed the eclipse but </p>
<p>nevertheless saw a most beautiful sight. The orange light around the </p>
<p>visible part of the sky, which is characteristic of a total eclipse, </p>
<p>was reflected in bright spots from the lowest areas of the cloud. </p>
<p>These orange spots, by contrast, turned the remaining parts of the </p>
<p>cloud a gorgeous deep purple. The effect was rather like the path of </p>
<p>moonlight reflected from water, but upside down and extending all </p>
<p>around us, instead of being in a rather narrow strip.</p>
<p>This was disappointing to the Canadian officers, and even more so to </p>
<p>Dr. Menzel and his crew. The patch of cloud over us could not have </p>
<p>been more than perhaps twenty miles in diameter, and I learned from </p>
<p>news reports that this was the only cloudy place along the entire </p>
<p>Canadian part of the eclipse track. So my whimsy cost me the sight </p>
<p>of my first visible total eclipse at which I had no duties. The </p>
<p>tests of LF Loran, however, were quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>7. October 2, 1959</p>
<p>This eclipse proved to be a total fiasco for both of us. The path </p>
<p>was practically in our back yard, so we took the children and stayed </p>
<p>overnight in a motel in Nahant, a dozen miles east of Arlington. As </p>
<p>the sun in that location was supposed to rise in mid-eclipse, we got </p>
<p>up in deep darkness to find ourselves under black clouds in a heavy </p>
<p>and persistent downpour. We could not even detect any brightening as </p>
<p>the time approached when the eclipse was supposed to end.</p>
<p>8. July 20, 1963</p>
<p>The track of this one passed through western Maine and we finally </p>
<p>got the children to see a total solar eclipse, although only by a </p>
<p>slim margin. The American Association of Variable Star Observers, of </p>
<p>which Catherine had been a member ever since her college days </p>
<p>(although she never, so far as I know, observed a variable star), </p>
<p>decided that the eclipse made a splendid opportunity for a meeting. </p>
<p>This was, technically legitimate as the brightness of the sun does </p>
<p>vary a little, although by no means noticeably. A second cousin of </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "Telster" Eclipse 357</p>
<p>mine, Cyrus Fernald, lived in Wilton, Maine, not far from the </p>
<p>eclipse path. He was a stalwart of the AAVSO and, as it happened, </p>
<p>Catherine had known him for years before she ever heard of me. The </p>
<p>AAVSO decided to take its telescopes to a site between Wilton and </p>
<p>the Telstar station in North Andover, Maine.</p>
<p>The Bell Telephone Laboratories was then making its first </p>
<p>experiments in transmitting television signals between America and </p>
<p>Europe, using a satellite called Telstar which was, I believe, the </p>
<p>first active satellite used for that purpose. Through Cyrus and </p>
<p>Catherine I found myself asked to arrange a visit to the Telstar </p>
<p>station for the entire AAVSO party. This came about because, before </p>
<p>1950, Dr. James Fisk had retired from a promising career at the Bell </p>
<p>Laboratories and become a professor of Applied Physics at Harvard, </p>
<p>where I had a slight acquaintance with him. After two years, he had </p>
<p>returned to the Bell Labs and, by the date of the eclipse, had </p>
<p>become its president.</p>
<p>The pressure by Catherine and Cyrus upon me was intolerable, so I </p>
<p>wrote Dr. Fisk to ask him to arrange a visit to the Telstar station </p>
<p>for a group of about 120 people with considerably greater scientific </p>
<p>understanding than the general public. It was perhaps unfortunate </p>
<p>that the eclipse came on Saturday afternoon so that the only </p>
<p>reasonable time for people to get to Andover would be late Sunday </p>
<p>morning, as many would need to leave for home that afternoon. After </p>
<p>I had written this request, nothing was heard about it for a </p>
<p>considerable time. Just as I was getting quite concerned, the phone </p>
<p>began to ring and I soon found myself talking to telephone company </p>
<p>people in Boston, Andover, New York and, for some reason I never </p>
<p>learned, in Washington. I could then visualize Dr. Fisk as having </p>
<p>written "Do this" on my letter, and leaving it to an army of </p>
<p>assistants to make the detailed arrangements.</p>
<p>When the great Saturday came, we drove for an hour or more from our </p>
<p>motel to the appointed field in a heavy rain. This gradually </p>
<p>decreased, but we ate our sandwich lunch in the car and set up our </p>
<p>projection telescope in a drizzle, as did all the other AAVSO </p>
<p>members and their families. At almost the latest possible moment, a </p>
<p>small clear space in the sky, perhaps six or eight degrees high and </p>
<p>twenty degrees long, appeared in just the right place. The clear </p>
<p>spot among the clouds drifted a little but managed to contain the </p>
<p>sun continuously from first contact to a few minutes after totality </p>
<p>ended. We saw all the important effects very well, but in the time </p>
<p>between third contact and the end of the eclipse the clouds became </p>
<p>opaque again.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning we drove to Andover in clear weather, getting </p>
<p>there at about eleven. Instead of needing, as did the uninvited </p>
<p>public, to peer into the balloon dome, some 200 feet in diameter, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="telstarparty">The Telstar Party</b> </a>358</p>
<p>through a plate glass window, we were escorted through double doors </p>
<p>into the dome itself. The huge antenna, essentially a conical horn </p>
<p>forty or fifty feet long with an attached 115 degree mirror at its </p>
<p>larger end, was laid horizontally on a rotating platform that filled </p>
<p>most of the inflated sphere. This platform was mounted on </p>
<p>essentially trolley-car wheels that rolled on a 150-foot circle of </p>
<p>rails that had been leveled and smoothed to about a thousandth of an </p>
<p>inch. The horn and mirror rotated about a horizontal axis while the </p>
<p>whole platform rotated about a vertical axis, with both motions </p>
<p>controlled by computer to let the antenna follow a satellite as it </p>
<p>crossed the sky.</p>
<p>Between the track for the antenna and the dome itself, ten or a </p>
<p>dozen large picnic tables had been set up. We were all seated at </p>
<p>these and given an excellent lobster luncheon while the manager and </p>
<p>the chief engineer of the station explained its details to us. One </p>
<p>interesting and non-technical feature was a group of small holes in </p>
<p>the center of the top. It seems that after the sphere had been </p>
<p>inflated but before the equipment had been installed, a heavy storm </p>
<p>had deposited enough snow on the top to depress the canvas into a </p>
<p>large dimple because the available air pressure could not support so </p>
<p>much weight. When the snow melted it left a pool weighing many tons </p>
<p>high in the air with no way of getting access to it. The solution </p>
<p>was to engage a local farmer to bring his hunting rifle and shoot a </p>
<p>few holes in the ceiling. The water gradually drained down through </p>
<p>the holes. After the driving equipment and some heaters had been </p>
<p>installed, the internal temperature was such that snow never </p>
<p>accumulated again.</p>
<p>After the luncheon and discussion, we were shown through the entire </p>
<p>station. I remember being especially impressed by the extent to </p>
<p>which normal telephone techniques had been used, so that people on </p>
<p>the telephone companies' staffs could easily adapt to this new </p>
<p>development.</p>
<p>Before and during the time when we were eating and talking, the big </p>
<p>antenna had been searching for the first Telstar satellite which had </p>
<p>been lost (or more probably had fallen silent) a few days before. It </p>
<p>was being searched for by followtng with the antenna the track </p>
<p>through the sky from which it was believed that the signal would </p>
<p>come. To increase the likelihood of success, this moving average </p>
<p>position was modified by adding a spiral scan that alternately </p>
<p>increased and decreased in radius. This combination of motions, when </p>
<p>changed into altitude and azimuth terms, caused a most curious and </p>
<p>ever-varying back-and-forth rotation of the wheels on the track and </p>
<p>of the cone on the platform. It is my impression that contact with </p>
<p>that first satellite was never re-established, but I am not sure. At </p>
<p>least, telephone and television communication across oceans is now </p>
<p>so common as to excite little interest, except for the few people </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="lasteclipse">Telstar / Our Last Eclipse</b> </a>359</p>
<p>who understand all of the difficulties.</p>
<p>It is perhaps not necessary to add that, since this splendid </p>
<p>luncheon and reception of the AAVSO group at Andover, the magnitude </p>
<p>of my telephone bill disturbs me much less than before. And I trust </p>
<p>that all the AAVSO members join me in this sentiment.</p>
<p>9. July 11, 1972</p>
<p>We made up a party of four for this eclipse and chose Prince Edward </p>
<p>Island as the place to see it. Professor and Mrs. Bancroft Sitterly </p>
<p>flew from Washington to Bangor, where we met them with our car. </p>
<p>Benny was the astronomer who did so much to elucidate the </p>
<p>mathematics of Loran navigation in the Radiation Laboratory, and </p>
<p>Charlotte was the astronomer who had shared Catherine's bed at the </p>
<p>Lick Observatory more than forty years earlier. Both have remained </p>
<p>among our closest friends ever since we met them. We drove across </p>
<p>New Brunswick, stopping to traverse the covered bridge, almost a </p>
<p>quarter of a mile long, that crosses the St. John river at Hartland, </p>
<p>and to see at Moncton the tidal bore which, at that distance up the </p>
<p>Petitcodiac River, was little more than a rapidly rising tide. </p>
<p>Taking the ferry to Summerside, we drove to Charlottetown and found </p>
<p>the rooms we had reserved. We visited the hall in which the Canadian </p>
<p>Federation of Provinces was established and, of course, Green </p>
<p>Gables, as both ladies had been fond of the story of Anne.</p>
<p>On eclipse day, we drove to the north side of the island, where we </p>
<p>understood that the eclipse would last longest, but retreated to the </p>
<p>southern coast when a thin haze developed in the north. We saw the </p>
<p>eclipse well and attracted a good deal of interest with our </p>
<p>telescopic projection of the partial phases, as we had set it up in </p>
<p>a public park.</p>
<p>The next day after the eclipse we started for Nova Scotia, </p>
<p>fortunately according to plan, as we had to wait from before noon </p>
<p>until nine-thirty at night to be let onto a ferry. Happily, we had </p>
<p>many books in the car so that all could read while we waited in </p>
<p>line; but we were very irritated when every truck full of chickens </p>
<p>or potatoes was sent on the next terry while passenger cars waited. </p>
<p>At Truro, the proprietor of our motel had waited up for our arrival. </p>
<p>From the motel grounds we could watch the tidal bore in the next </p>
<p>morning and evening. This was better than the one at Moncton, as the </p>
<p>initial bore came up the river over bare sand at a height of about </p>
<p>two and a half feet. This was followed by a great many secondary </p>
<p>surges that brought the depth of water up to fourteen feet in forty </p>
<p>minutes. We did some exploration of the south coast of Nova Scotia </p>
<p>before other appointments made by the Sitterlys forced us to let </p>
<p>them leave by air from Halifax. We decided that we would meet again </p>
<p>to see more 6f Nova Scotia the next year. That trip was postponed by </p>

<p>I believe that Catherine. thought that she had tried to see eight </p>
<p>total solar eclipses. I am unable to find listed in our astronomy </p>
<p>books more than seven that she could have seen. In either case, her </p>
<p>record was remarkable as she actually saw six eclipses in seven </p>
<p>chances, if not seven out of eight. I too have been in attendance at </p>
<p>seven total eclipses, but have seen only four, a much more normal </p>
<p>ratio.</p>

</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The five years before I retired in 1974 were largely devoted to </p>
<p>studying some interesting details of propagational phenomena that </p>
<p>seemed to me important in the use of Omega. There was a gradual </p>
<p>decrease in research funds, as I said above, because the Omega </p>
<p>Project Office had decided (wrongly, I felt) that because the system </p>
<p>was reaching operational status further research would not be </p>
<p>required. This fact did not trouble me as much as might be expected, </p>
<p>however, as I was quite annoyed at the thought of the many years of </p>
<p>what seemed unnecessary fears and delays since my proposal of the </p>
<p>idea. In other words, I was getting old and weary. I also realized </p>
<p>that the Navy could have become tired of having me suggest new ideas </p>
<p>and modifications that might interfere with its somewhat placid and </p>
<p>leisurely habits.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>For four years I occupied a position on the Science Advisory </p>
<p>Committee of the U.S. Coast Guard, a new effort for them. I was made </p>
<p>the leader of a small panel worrying about problems in electronics. </p>
<p>While we examined many aspects of the varied services performed by </p>
<p>the Coast Guard, perhaps our most important contribution was to help </p>
<p>convince the Commandant that the service would benefit from having </p>
<p>its own Research and Development Laboratory. At about the time I </p>
<p>retired, the nucleus of such an organization was established in </p>
<p>temporary quarters on the coast of Connecticut, pending arrangements </p>
<p>to build a permanent laboratory on the grounds of the Coast Guard </p>
<p>Academy in New London.</p>
<p>After I retired from the Committee, was interested to find that I </p>
<p>was given a Public Service Commendation calling attention to my help </p>
<p>in the development of vessel traffic systems. This referred to an </p>
<p>effort of the whole committee, with which I had relatively little to </p>
<p>do. It was essentially another example of the old problem of </p>
<p>relieving the captains of ships of some responsibility, especially </p>
<p>in cases where danger to other vessels was of paramount importance. </p>
<p>It was very clear that it would be necessary to give the Coast Guard </p>
<p>the right to require certain behavior of vessels when entering </p>
<p>American harbors or traversing the coastal zone where traffic was </p>
<p>heavy. This problem was exactly equivalent to air traffic control, </p>
<p>where some rights had to be withdrawn from individual craft to </p>
<p>increase the safety of all. In this case, it had to be approached </p>
<p>through the testing of a system of harbor advisory radars which </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>362</p>
<p>could identify approaching vessels and offer suggestions about their </p>
<p>movements. The time for supplanting the absolute authority of </p>
<p>captains had surely arrived, but for a while the Coast Guard had to </p>
<p>operate in a purely advisory capacity. In some cases, such as when </p>
<p>large oil tankers turned northward in San Francisco Bay to pass </p>
<p>through a region that was often occupied by a thousand or more small </p>
<p>sailboats which theoretically had the right of way, things were very </p>
<p>difficult indeed. The only solution, as in the English Channel and </p>
<p>many other congested areas, was to allocate routes to various </p>
<p>classes of vessels, and to give the Coast Guard authority to enforce </p>
<p>the rules. All this took a lot of time and a lot of diplomacy, but </p>
<p>not much of either of them was required from the Committee.</p>
<p>At that time the Navy was making arrangements to have the Coast </p>
<p>Guard operate those Omega stations under U.S. control. I spent some </p>
<p>of my Advisory Committee time in trying to encourage the Coast Guard </p>
<p>to adopt an aggressive policy of supporting research on Omega, but </p>
<p>with no results whatever, at least before my retirement. It was much </p>
<p>too easy for the Coast Guard to perform only the operating services </p>
<p>that the Navy would pay for and to exert none of its own guiding </p>
<p>influences. I hope that this policy has by now been corrected.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard had two customs with respect to the committee that </p>
<p>had my entire approval. They called meetings, usually of three days </p>
<p>duration, at many different places so that we could see for </p>
<p>ourselves some of the very varied things they did; and they actually </p>
<p>paid the committee members a modest fee of $100 per day, which was </p>
<p>then unusual among government agencies. They even called all </p>
<p>meetings to begin in time for dinner on the evenings before the </p>
<p>business sessions in order to legitimize an extra hundred dollars </p>
<p>for each of us.</p>
<p>I found amusing a few details about some of the meetings. One that </p>
<p>was perhaps interesting rather than amusing was a session at </p>
<p>President Nixon's Western White House, which he liked to have used </p>
<p>for conferences of small groups when he was elsewhere. The White </p>
<p>House consisted of two or three single-story temporary buildings on </p>
<p>the property of a Loran station that happened to be adjacent to the </p>
<p>President's new home at San Clemente, California. I did not visit </p>
<p>the Loran station, but we did have time to tour the grounds which </p>
<p>surrounded the President's house and admire the quite attractive </p>
<p>sentry boxes scattered here and there among the trees.</p>
<p>Particularly interesting was an artificial hill which Mr. Nixon had </p>
<p>caused to be erected by marines from Camp Pendleton to cut off a </p>
<p>distant view of trains on the coastal line, which unfortunately ran </p>
<p>behind the bluff between the estate and the ocean. We, of course, </p>
<p>all came home with an assortment of valueless souvenirs, such as </p>
<p>match books and paper napkins identified as belonging to the Western </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="coastguard">The Coast Guard Science Advisory Committee</b> </a>363</p>
<p>White House.</p>
<p>Having grown up near 45 degrees north latitude, I was somewhat </p>
<p>surprised, when we had a meeting at Mobile, Alabama, to find that </p>
<p>that was the home port of the helicopters used to search for </p>
<p>channels through ice floes for ships in the arctic regions, as well </p>
<p>as to carry out search and rescue missions as required. It took me </p>
<p>a little time to realize that the helicopters were as likely to be </p>
<p>dispatched to the south polar regions as to the northerly ones, and </p>
<p>that they might as well be stationed at some place having a </p>
<p>comfortable climate.</p>
<p>I have always thought of the Coast Guard as a nuts and bolts sort of </p>
<p>practical service, with a myriad of assorted duties, that could </p>
<p>undertake successfully almost any job. This complimentary attitude </p>
<p>was a little damped by the discovery that it had taken until that </p>
<p>year (1971, I believe) to learn that for service in the arctic and </p>
<p>antarctic it was better to paint the helicopters in fluorescent </p>
<p>orange rather than in the Coast Guard's customary white. I thus came </p>
<p>to realize that a governmental body may follow an old habit </p>
<p>slavishly, without any actual thought, as easily as I can.</p>
<p>At Governor's Island in New York harbor the committee found much of </p>
<p>the perimeter of the island occupied by large heaps of dirt from </p>
<p>many excavations. We were told that extensive changes had just been </p>
<p>made in the sewage system of the base, on which about 6,000 people </p>
<p>lived, with thousands more who came each day by ferry. There had </p>
<p>been, I believe, some twenty-odd outlets which had discharged raw </p>
<p>sewage into New York harbor. The Coast Guard had recently been </p>
<p>assigned the duty of inspecting ships' dispositions for the </p>
<p>treatment of sewage, and it had become embarrassing to have such a </p>
<p>large problem of its own while being required to discipline even </p>
<p>small ships for having inadequate sanitary provisions.</p>
<p>As a result, the various small sewers on the island had been dug up </p>
<p>and connected to a new main conduit passing under Buttermilk Channel </p>
<p>to South Brooklyn, where it joined a larger New York City sewer. It </p>
<p>was, of course, not a responsibility of the Coast Guard .that the </p>
<p>New York sewer then passed two blocks farther south and emptied into </p>
<p>the harbor.</p>
<p>One of the members of the committee pointed out that it was </p>
<p>unfortunate that the Coast Guard had to expend some of its efforts </p>
<p>in these inspections of incoming ships, as there were surely more </p>
<p>porpoises swimming in an ocean than there were men sailing on its </p>
<p>surface.</p>
<p>I hope that these anecdotes are not taken as implying any lack of </p>
<p>respect for the Coast Guard. I have always admired it as an over </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="ironsides">Coast Guard / Old Ironsides</b> </a>364</p>
<p>loaded Service which does not expend its energy on training, as do </p>
<p>the military and naval arms, but works hard and faithfully at </p>
<p>impossibly varied and difficult tasks, from mounting guard against </p>
<p>icebergs and drug smugglers to replacing buoys in the Mississippi </p>
<p>River and inspecting life-preservers on small pleasure craft </p>
<p>operated by owners of doubtful sobriety. These officers and men </p>
<p>could not be given too much praise. It will be a fortunate day when </p>
<p>our national budget gets under control so that they can be </p>
<p>adequately funded for the important services they are obliged to </p>
<p>perform. </p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>In my boyhood I was an avid reader of tales of the exploits of the </p>
<p>United States Frigate Constitution. As a delayed consequence, I took </p>
<p>steps in 1973 to get myself invited to take a very short trip on Old </p>
<p>Ironsides when I heard that she was about to go into drydock for a </p>
<p>three-years refitting. Fortunately, this turned out to be the first </p>
<p>year when ladies were allowed on such a turn around cruise (so </p>
<p>called as the ship was taken out into the harbor and turned each </p>
<p>year to make the effects of weathering equal on both sides), so </p>
<p>Catherine and I were duly invited, to join the ship at the somewhat </p>
<p>inconvenient hour of seven in the morning.</p>
<p>The Constitution was towed from her normal berth in the Charlestown </p>
<p>Navy Yard two or three miles along the Boston waterfront before </p>
<p>turning back and entering the drydock in which she would be </p>
<p>refitted. She carried a Naval band, which played more or less </p>
<p>continuously, and was accompanied by fireboats squirting high </p>
<p>fountains of water and by innumerable small boats carrying people </p>
<p>with cameras. We were also kept in view by four or five helicopters </p>
<p>taking movies of our slow progression. Catherine and I, and perhaps </p>
<p>a hundred, other guests, were given handsomely illuminated </p>
<p>certificates attesting our contributions to the success of this </p>
<p>voyage and designating us as Honorary Navigators in the Continental </p>
<p>At the end of the voyage Catherine's lameness made it a little </p>
<p>difficult as the ship was then in a huge dry-dock and we had to </p>
<p>debark over a very long and steep gangplank. She was, I think, quite </p>
<p>pleased to be helped ashore by no less than two Lieutenant </p>
<p>Commanders. She later took a little pride in being one of the first </p>
<p>ladies to travel on Old Ironsides, until I found that in 1849 the </p>
<p>ship had had to convey an American Consul from Tripoli to </p>
<p>Alexandria. Catherine then had to give up her claim, because the </p>
<p>consul's son was born on board, an event that could not have </p>
<p>occurred without a lady present. The son was, of course, named </p>
<p>Constitution McCauley.</p>
<p>My interest in Old Ironsides brought me a curio I enjoy. It was </p>
<p>given to me at the time of my retirement by Ryder Eriksen, the only </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="novascotia">Old Ironsides / Nova Scotia</b> </a>365</p>
<p>technician who stayed in my group at Harvard throughout my post-war </p>
<p>years. This souvenir is a pair of book-ends, cast in a metal that </p>
<p>seems to be at least partly bronze. They were made of material </p>
<p>removed from the frigate Constitution at the time of her renovation </p>
<p>in 1927-1930, and had been bought by Ryder's father. The form of the </p>
<p>bookends is the conventional ship's steering wheel with a medallion </p>

<p>In Chapter 28 I described the trip Catherine and I took with </p>
<p>Charlotte and Bancroft Sitterly to see a total eclipse in Prince </p>
<p>Edward Island. On that occasion we had a very happy time exploring </p>
<p>parts of Maine and New Brunswick, but in Nova Scotia saw only the </p>
<p>narrow strip of between Truro and Halifax. We fully intended to go </p>
<p>to Nova Scotia again the next year, but something made us postpone </p>
<p>the trip until 1974.</p>
<p>I cannot remember the dates with precision, but I fancy that I </p>
<p>technically retired on June 30th of that year somewhere in Nova </p>
<p>Scotia. The trips in 1972 and 1974 were made in the best period; </p>
<p>that is, when strawberries had come into the market while the </p>
<p>lobster season had not yet ended. I fancy that it was in New </p>
<p>Brunswick in 1972 that Banny and I standardized the pink and white </p>
<p>luncheon; that is, a bowl of lobster stew followed by strawberry </p>
<p>shortcake. Thereafter we enjoyed this fine menu nearly every noon </p>
<p>while we were in the Maritime Provinces.</p>
<p>For this second joint trip to that area Catherine and I took the </p>
<p>ferry from Portland to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, while Charlotte and </p>
<p>Banny flew to Halifax. We visited Peggy's Cove and other points of </p>
<p>interest near Halifax and then drove along the southeast coast, </p>
<p>stopping at every village that seemed interesting. After a night at </p>
<p>Antigonish, we crossed the causeway onto Cape Breton Island, our </p>
<p>chief objective.</p>
<p>For several days we made our headquarters at a delightful inn at </p>
<p>Baddeck, on Bras d'Or Lake almost in the center of the Island. As </p>
<p>three of us were then forced to use canes, we stayed on the ground </p>
<p>floor of an annex that was just opening for the season. This </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="marconi">The Marconi Site</b> </a>366</p>
<p>building had an attractively furnished parlor, and rather long </p>
<p>private rooms that gradually changed from bedroom near the door to </p>
<p>living-room at the end near the windows, which looked out upon a </p>
<p>yard and garden with flowering trees. Almost immediately after our </p>
<p>arrival a procession of seven or eight chambermaids came into the </p>
<p>parlor, each bearing two or three brass candlesticks or decorative </p>
<p>utensils that had obviously just been polished to begin the season. </p>
<p>The dining room, in the main inn, was also beautiful, but insisted </p>
<p>on serving meals far more complete and delicious than any of us felt </p>
<p>we needed. Fortunately or unfortunately, the only other place for a </p>
<p>good dinner in Baddeck had recently been damaged by fire and was not </p>
<p>open for business!</p>
<p>From this inn it was an easy day's run to any of the points of </p>
<p>interest in that most eastern part of Nova Scotia. We spent one day </p>
<p>touring the Cabot Trail, in a clockwise direction so that we could </p>
<p>end with a memorable dinner at Keltic Lodge. Another day was spent </p>
<p>mostly at Louisbourg where the fortress (which William Pepperell, </p>
<p>assisted by one or two of my remote ancestors, captured temporarily </p>
<p>in 1745) has been handsomely restored. In Baddeck itself we found </p>
<p>the Alexander Graham Bell museum very interesting, with its, </p>
<p>concentration on Bell's devotion to kites and aircraft in the latter </p>
<p>part of his life.</p>
<p>My most memorable stop was at Glace Bay to see the site of Guglielmo </p>
<p>Marconi's first wireless station on the North American side of the </p>
<p>Atlantic. The place does have a small monument, but it is not well </p>
<p>advertised so that I had to enquire at a bank to get instructions </p>
<p>for finding the site, even though it is really in the city itself. </p>
<p>It is on the top of a rocky headland (a very poor site for a low-</p>
<p>frequency radio station) perhaps a hundred feet above the water, and </p>
<p>with a magnificent view of the sea.</p>
<p>There was a little dirt and grass in crannies, but half the area </p>
<p>seemed to be completely bare. The footing of one tower was nearly </p>
<p>intact, although the frost had heaved it into a tilted position, and </p>
<p>I could identify the hole from which the remains of another must </p>
<p>have been recently removed. There had originally been four towers, </p>
<p>but I could find no trace of the other two positions although the </p>
<p>geometry of the square, some four hundred feet on a side, seemed to </p>
<p>be clear. The footing that still existed was not more than five feet </p>
<p>square and perhaps two feet in thickness; a rather small support </p>
<p>for a tower two or three hundred feet high and carrying part of the </p>
<p>weight of a complex network of heavy wires or cables.</p>
<p>The remains of foundations for three buildings could still be </p>
<p>identified. They were of concrete only about five inches wide and </p>
<p>barely deep enough to establish a plane just above the rocky </p>
<p>surface, the height ranging from six to eighteen inches. These </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Marconi Site 367</p>
<p>footings, like those of the towers, were made of concrete with </p>
<p>minimum cement and lots of sand and small stones. The top surface of </p>
<p>the tower support, however, was decorated by a layer of waterworn </p>
<p>pebbles of various colors, presumably brought up from the beach </p>
<p>below the cliff.</p>
<p>The sight of these remains gave me an answer to a question that had </p>
<p>intrigued me for years why did Marconi abandon this site after at </p>
<p>Glace Bay after only two or three years of use and replace it with a </p>
<p>new station less than ten miles away on the other side of a </p>
<p>peninsula? The niggardly use of cement clearly suggested to me that </p>
<p>a financial problem had forced construction of a station that soon </p>
<p>began to need repairs.</p>
<p>It seems clear that Marconi could afford nothing better until after </p>
<p>he had proven the utility of transatlantic wireless communication.</p>
<p>I fear that my three companions did not share my happiness in </p>
<p>exploring this bleak promontory. They were, however, very patient </p>
<p>with my pacing of dimensions and trying to see all of what little </p>
<p>there was.</p>
<p>The word seeing reminds me of my surprise at Banny's acute vision. I </p>
<p>did all the driving on these trips with Banny beside me in the front </p>
<p>seat, and no automobile ever traveled with such an excellent </p>
<p>navigator. He invariably had mastered the maps before we reached any </p>
<p>waypoint, but what really amazed me was that he could always read </p>
<p>the names on the street signs at a hundred yards distance, and often </p>
<p>before I had detected the sign itself. I need not say that we never </p>
<p>overshot a turning point. And Banny was close to eighty years old in </p>
<p>1974!</p>
<p>After the Sitterlys left us, again by airplane, Catherine and I took </p>
<p>the ferry from Yarmouth to Bar Harbor. This was a day trip that got </p>
<p>us there at or just after dusk. We decided that word of some </p>
<p>suspected smuggler had reached the customs officers, as we waited an </p>
<p>hour or more for service and then had to get out of the car while </p>
<p>they searched every nook and cranny. We were lucky to reach our </p>
<p>motel in Ellsworth soon after midnight.</p>

<b><p><a name="retire">After My Retirement</a></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost as soon as we returned from Nova Scotia in 1974, I began to </p>
<p>compose this memoir, The project went ahead rapidly throughout most </p>
<p>of the first year. I wrote, as I still do, almost entirely by pen, </p>
<p>especially with a beautiful big Mont Blanc, given me at retirement </p>
<p>by the last three people in my group. After a few months in whic4h </p>
<p>I, from time to time, revised parts of the composition, I typed it </p>
<p>double-spaced and for several years continued to edit it </p>
<p>occasionally.</p>
<p>In May of 1975 the Navy presented me with the Robert Dexter Conrad </p>
<p>Award for Scientific Achievement for my work on Omega. This is, or </p>
<p>was, the Navy's only award for science. It was named for Captain </p>
<p>Conrad, who had been Admiral Purer's deputy, in the former Office of </p>
<p>Research and Inventions. At Admiral Purer's retirement, Captain </p>
<p>Conrad had become a leader in the organization of the Office of </p>
<p>Naval Research until he suddenly succumbed to leukemia and died. I </p>
<p>was greatly pleased that the Chief of Naval Research, Rear Admiral </p>
<p>Richard Van Orden, whom I had known a little as a Lieutenant-</p>
<p>Commander at San Diego many years earlier, chose to come to </p>
<p>Cambridge to present the award in person. I was greatly surprised to </p>
<p>find that the award included a gold medal, which I had never heard </p>
<p>about until the Admiral produced it and pinned it onto my jacket.</p>
<p>The years before the disintegration of Catherine's health were </p>
<p>brightened for us by three honorary memberships in societies formed </p>
<p>to support special interests. The first, in 1977, came from the </p>
<p>International Omega Association, a small group interested in that </p>
<p>specific aid to navigation. Another, in 1979, testified to </p>
<p>recognition of my contributions by the much larger Institute of </p>
<p>Navigation; and the third, in 1980, was from, the Wild Goose </p>
<p>Association. This consists of people especially interested in the </p>
<p>development of Loran. I have thus learned that there are at least </p>
<p>two small societies formed by aficionados of aids to navigation in </p>
<p>which I am still deeply interested.</p>
<p>These, like most such certifications of honorary membership, made </p>
<p>rather exaggerated statements about abilities and accomplishments </p>
<p>which I do not feel it necessary to quote. I do, however, cherish </p>
<p>especially these memberships in groups that presumably know </p>
<p>accurately what I have done.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1987, I was asked by the editor of the quarterly </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>369</p>
<p>newsletter of the International Omega Association to write a short </p>
<p>account of the origin of Omega to be quoted in that publication, </p>
<p>This I wrote in three parts, one dealing with my youth and early </p>
<p>activities at Harvard, and one part each about Loran and Omega. I </p>
<p>had assumed that these would appear in successive issues of the </p>
<p>newsletter, but the editor decided to use all my material in a </p>
<p>single special issue, which was published in very attractive form in </p>
<p>July, 1988. It was embellished by an introduction by Eric Swanson, </p>
<p>the still-active expert from NEL (now the Navy Ocean Systems Center) </p>
<p>who probably knows most about my work. This special issue also shows </p>
<p>two or three pictures of me, in various eras, and a copy of the </p>
<p>letter of congratulation from the Assistant Secretary of the Navy </p>
<p>for Research and Development on the occasion of the awarding of the </p>
<p>Conrad Award. The editor, Bob Revel, also topped off the issue with </p>
<p>my answers to a few questions he had asked. The Special Issue is a </p>
<p>very attractive booklet and I am grateful that the IOA has given me </p>
<p>enough copies so that I can send one to each of my descendants.</p>
<p>I am confident that this editor was also the instigator of a </p>
<p>proposal to send me to Munich in the coming October to attend the </p>
<p>Annual Meeting of the IOA. This plan is largely to allow me to see </p>
<p>Omega in operation as a navigational aid, as I had happened to </p>
<p>mention that I had never seen it at work on a moving vehicle. I am </p>
<p>happy to have the invitation and trust that I can attend the meeting </p>
<p>as scheduled and so learn much about developments in the use of </p>
<p>Omega in the fourteen years since my retirement.</p>
<p>Another event that is still in the future will presumably be the </p>
<p>awarding of the Elmer A. Sperry Award, given under the auspices of a </p>
<p>consortium of five large societies of engineers. This, I am told, is </p>
<p>to be given this fall to the Omega System, with me as its </p>
<p>representative.</p>
<p>The system is thus to be complimented as a distinguished engineering </p>
<p>contribution which,, through application, proved in actual service, </p>
<p>has advanced the art of transportation.</p>
<p>I speak here of these future expectations only because I now feel </p>
<p>quite sure that I shall complete this long memoir before the autumn </p>
<p>season is over.</p>
</font><p><hr>
<font face="Courier New" size="2"><p><a name="computer"></a></p>
<p>In the chapter about Catherine I did not mention the fact that some </p>
<p>six months before she died I had succumbed to the lure of the </p>
<p>personal computer, at least in the form of a word processor. At that </p>
<p>time I had completed this memoir through Chapter 22. I had not </p>
<p>written much in the preceding four, or five years, but had edited </p>
<p>and re-edited the earlier work at odd moments. I had also enjoyed </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p>My First (and only) Computer</b> 370</p>
<p>the inestimable advantage of Catherine's sharp eye and sensitive </p>
<p>ear. She had read and improved much that I had written.</p>
<p>It happened that I bought the computer at one place, the word-</p>
<p>processing program at another, and a printer at a third. I was a </p>
<p>little startled and worried, when I came to put them together, to </p>
<p>realize that I had no experience with a computer and a total of </p>
<p>thirteen pounds of instruction books. All went quite smoothly, </p>
<p>however, and I was soon making fairly efficient use of the machine.</p>
<p>This was about the most fortunate timing of a purchase I had ever </p>
<p>had. There was much text well prepared and needing little </p>
<p>modification ready to be put on to discs. Thus, in the most </p>
<p>difficult six months of Catherine's illness, I was able to go to the </p>
<p>keyboard, at any time when I was free for a half-hour or so, and </p>
<p>transcribe my typewritten text with no requirement for more than </p>
<p>purely mechanical operation. I found this to be a most valuable </p>
<p>relief and therapy. I could devote my attention to the typing, </p>
<p>releasing my mind from the continuous worry, and still hear </p>
<p>Catherine if she needed anything. It may not be too much to say that </p>
<p>this simple task alone perhaps maintained my sanity during that </p>
<p>terrible period.</p>
<p>It is interesting, at least to me, to observe how much the quality </p>
<p>of my writing has declined from Chapter 23 onward. This may be </p>
<p>caused by the absence of Catherine's good advice, or perhaps by my </p>
<p>advancing age, but I feel that much of the decline arises simply </p>
<p>from the loneliness I feel in her absence. It is clearly harder to </p>
<p>get myself re-started at writing since her death, and at times </p>
<p>months go by before I can attack writing again. It is a great relief </p>
<p>to find myself so nearly finished, except for the index I hope to </p>
<p>compose. I look forward to this part as a purely mechanical </p>
<p>operation requiring little thought and, in a way, much like the </p>
<p>earlier transcription to the discs.</p>
<p>I am glad that Catherine did not hear of the need of our daughter </p>
<p>Joy to obtain (or possibly to agree to) a divorce, after sixteen </p>
<p>years of marriage and three children. I learned about the problem of </p>
<p>a divorce only a couple of'months after Catherine died. It soon </p>
<p>became clear that the best solution to Joy's and my problems would </p>
<p>be for me to sell the Arlington house and to buy one we could share </p>
<p>in New Hampshire where she had good friends.</p>
<p>Joy managed the selection of a house very intelligently. She kept a </p>
<p>couple of horses, a pony, a goat, and several house pets. We </p>
<p>therefore would require a place with barn and paddock, which greatly </p>
<p>limited the possibilities. Joy had, and still has, a close friend, </p>
<p>also horsey, who, with her husband, was having a new house built in </p>
<p>a neighboring town. Joy caused me to come to New Hampshire to be </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p><a name="selling">Selling and Moving</b> </a>371</p>
<p>shown several houses by a realtor. None of them were at all </p>
<p>satisfactory, but they taught me to understand the prices that were </p>
<p>being asked in the vicinity. After dismissing the realtor, Joy then </p>
<p>took me to see the house of her friends, complete with barn, </p>
<p>paddock, and riding ring. I had no hesitation in agreeing to buy the </p>
<p>property, subject only to the assurance by a realtor friend in </p>
<p>Arlington that I could sell my house for enough to pay for the </p>
<p>property in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>Because we had to give Joy's friends time to finish their new home, </p>
<p>I sold my house in May for delivery in August. The sale was amazing </p>
<p>to me, as I then had no true idea of the real estate market in the </p>
<p>Boston area. It happened that my house was put on the market on a </p>
<p>Monday, two days after the newspapers had announced that Boston had </p>
<p>become the most expensive real estate market in the country. Silly </p>
<p>as it sounds, this seemed to have given people the idea that then </p>
<p>was the time to buy. My realtor friend (and former neighbor) brought </p>
<p>her force of agents to see the house in the morning. At eleven-</p>
<p>thirty they left to phone their potential customers, and I had a </p>
<p>busy afternoon, both at the telephone and at the door. At seven-</p>
<p>thirty that evening I signed the agreement to sell at considerably </p>
<p>more than the asking price. I actually received nearly twenty times </p>
<p>what Catherine and I had paid for the house in 1946, despite the </p>
<p>fact that it was about a hundred years old, in poor condition, and </p>
<p>on a small lot.</p>
<p>Because of the necessary delay in delivery, I could take my time in </p>
<p>disposing of things that would not fit into the smaller house in New </p>
<p>Hampshire. The only really difficult part was having to get rid of </p>
<p>about three thousand books, keeping only a thousand favorites. Soon </p>
<p>after my retirement I had finally prepared a card index of our books </p>
<p>and discovered that Catherine and I had bought a book for each five </p>
<p>days since we had been married. Of course, it was also hard to get </p>
<p>rid of the card index, as I could not find time to search out and </p>
<p>remove the cards as books were sold or given away.</p>
<p>Catherine had been such a good cook that I could give her new and </p>
<p>fine cookbooks several times a year. These were among her favorite </p>
<p>reading in her later years. I was delighted to find that the Schles </p>
<p>inger Library at Radcliffe, well-known for its collection of cook </p>
<p>books among other things important to women, was strong in foreign </p>
<p>cookbooks but relatively weak in American ones. They were happy to </p>
<p>accept about two-thirds of those that Catherine left. I can </p>
<p>therefore enjoy the idea that Catherine's name is preserved, if </p>
<p>nowhere else, on the bookplates of a hundred or more cookbooks in </p>
<p>that library.</p>
<p><a name="newhampshire"></a>I moved to Weare, New Hampshire, a town of about 4500 people less </p>
<p>than twenty miles west-south-west of Concord, at the end of August </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><p>New Hampshire</b> 372</p>
<p>in 1986, almost two years ago as I write this. The house is small </p>
<p>but attractive and the accomodation for animals is satisfactory. </p>
<p>Until I moved, a few days after Joy had occupied the house, I </p>
<p>expected that Joy and her daughter Jenny would be the only other </p>
<p>inhabitants as her two sons had chosen to live with their father. I </p>
<p>found that the older boy, Chris, had already left his father. At the </p>
<p>end of the next school year his brother Brett also chose to join us. </p>
<p>This makes the place somewhat crowded, but we have had two small </p>
<p>rooms finished in the basement so that we get along without too much </p>
<p>pressure for space.</p>
<p>Joy is an avid trail rider and a very aptive member of the New </p>
<p>Hampshire Equine Humane Association, a sort of minor S.P.C.A. for </p>
<p>horses that endeavors to teach people not to buy horses and then </p>
<p>neglect them. She keeps herself busy with her job, with frequent </p>
<p>rides with friends, and at times joining organized trail rides. At </p>
<p>any moment there may be a requirement for rescue efforts, if reports </p>
<p>of underweight or otherwise mistreated animals have been reported.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>When I retired I could not have believed that I would spend fourteen </p>
<p>years writing this memoir. It has been great fun for me to do the </p>
<p>remembering. Now that I have finished all I plan to write, I look </p>
<p>forward to compiling an index and then making enough copies for all </p>
<p>my descendants and perhaps a few friends.</p>
<p>When I get this done, I really will get at a four-drawer file of </p>
<p>papers that I could not bear to throw away when I retired. Some of </p>
<p>these may contain information interesting enough for the archives of </p>
<p>either Harvard or the University of Maine. I shall need to devote a </p>
<p>fair amount of time and energy to straightening out a rather </p>
<p>disorganized mass of material and composing enough introductory </p>
<p>explanations so that others can make some sense out of whatever I </p>
<p>choose to leave for them. This chore should help to fill my ever-</p>
<p>more-declining years. </p>
